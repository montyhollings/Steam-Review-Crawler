        "content": "This is a great sequel and spin-off of P5, it takes place after the events of P5 and has a completely new combat system. It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

        "content": "When this game was first revealed, I was honestly skeptical if a Persona installment would work with the mechanics of a Musou game. Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

        "content": "This game is everything I could ever want from a video game. The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one. Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

I was surprised to find that it's barely musou-like at all and is in fact a solid action RPG. Highly recommended for anybody who loved Persona 5.",

I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.",

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game.

He and the rest of his Friends decided to go camping after they've got reunited. \nWhile they were gathering equipment for that camping trip, they stumbled across the metaverse yet again but this time, it's used to steal the desires from innocent people to affect them in the real world. \nThe Phantom Thieves of hearts are back from their hiatus and ready to get those stolen desires back!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nUnlike the other persona spin-offs that were either turn based (like the main games) or 2d fighting games, this one is actually a hack and slay with persona traits in it like: \nweakness and resist, all out attacks, 1 more, debuffs and buffs, baton pass, the third eye, ambush and of course the ability to switch personas via wildcard (which is Joker). \nBut they also added many new things that are quite interesting like: \nbonds, master arts, showtimes, gaining personas by random drops, being able to use surroundings as an advantage and so on.\nThe dungeon crawling is also a big part of this game, so be prepared to slice through countless enemies while exploring the cognitive world!    \n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nWhat is there more to say? If you have played the main game, then you know every single persona Ost is a bop and this time it's no exception.\n\nYearning to hear some good old Persona classics come back, like \"rivers in the desert\" ? Fear not, this game won't let you down. \nYou want \"last surprise\" but more funky? Here you go buddy!\nYou want new Osts that slap ass? Well with axe to grind and daredevil, there's nothing you can do wrong. \nThrough the Legacy BGM Dlc which is available through the deluxe edition, it is also possible to change the Battle theme to another one of the previous games.\n\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nEven though I haven't played that much hack and slay in general, I still enjoyed this kind of experience. \nI think this game is a great addition to the persona franchise and a fresh take on the hack and slay genre. \nThe only thing I can recommend in addition is playing the main game before touching this game, to improve your understanding of the following story as well some parts of the gameplay.",

        "content": "[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i] and my twitch https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg\n\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is an action hack&slash spin-off/sorta sequel for the fantastic rpg, Persona 5, which sadly has not been released on PC, a game that fans will surely love even in a different gameplay style. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d [u]The good parts:[/u]\n+The same characters you loved in P5 are back with all their great chemistry. \n+Initially combat seems a mess but as you get deeper into it, especially on Hard, it gets quite fun and challenging at times. \n+Most of the music from P5 is back but there are some nice new songs as well.\n+Boss fights.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n-You need to play Persona 5 on PS4 else it will be incredibly hard to follow.\n-The story presentation is almost the same as the original P5 but with a different coating. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is in an odd spot for what it is. What I mean by that is, it does continue after the events of the original Persona 5 but the Royal version which is arguably much better is not canon in Strikers which puts it in a weird place. Unfortunately, you still need to play Persona 5 or Royal, to understand and appreciate the story and its characters. I say unfortunately but that isn't really a bad thing because you should 100% play the original games because they're amazing. \n\nNow onto Persona 5 Strikers story, you play as Joker again who returns for the summer vacation back to Shibuya. As he gets back together with the gang he again ends up in the prison where everything started in the original P5. He is warned that another calamity is about to happen just like before, even worse, and it's up to the Trickster to stop it again. \n\nThis time around you encounter Jails instead of Castles which are at their core the same but with a different skin/background. I won't spoil their nature but suffice to say they follow the same pattern, you roam around the maps which are more open now due to the nature of the gameplay, fight enemies, then the final boss, calling card all that, and repeat several times. Even the way the ending is presented is similar, you'll understand once you reach it. \n\nYou will meet new characters and some of them will even join your group to help you fight the upcoming calamity. As for the original cast, they're all back and they're all the same as you know and love them. Their presence is what makes the Persona 5 series great. Be warned though the game has a lot of dialogue in its full 45 hours and you'll be spending even an hour or more just listening and reading. \n\nStory rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs I've mentioned before P5S is a spin-off because this time around it's not a turn-based rpg anymore but an hack&slash with few rpg mechanics borrowed from the original game. \n\nThe core is there but simplified and turned into action. You roam around the maps, attack the enemies, and engage in combat but instead of turn-based, they now spread around the map and you basically Devil May Cry their ass using the Personas you gather or create which is the specific skill of the Trickster. The abilities and the Personas are the same but \"ported\" to live-action combat. What that means is besides slashing your way through huge waves of enemies, you can also use skills that you are familiar with in an aoe pattern. \n\nObviously, you will not be fighting alone and 3 of your preferred teammates will be there to assist you. They have their own AI and will use skills and attacks but you can switch to them and play as them if you want to which is highly encouraged especially on Hard. You cannot swap your teammates in combat, only outside, so make sure before a boss or tough sub-boss to be prepared who you have by your side. Their skills are also exactly the same as the original so you won't have to worry much about that if you played it. The spell combinations, technical damage, Persona, and enemy weakness are all back so really not much is changed at its core besides how combat is displayed. Boss fights are challenging on Hard but fair and they're really fantastic how they crafted and adapted the mechanics to the hack &slash style. \n\nAs P5S is no longer an rpg, all the bonds and talking and everything else you were used to in the original is gone or simplified. The bond system is a simple talent tree in which you spend points you gather progressively through the story and some side quests. Crafting Personas is also very simplified. If this were an actual rpg with mechanics improved from the original, it would've been an amazing experience but hey at least you can still cook stuff so that's a plus. \n\nGameplay rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nObviously, you can play the game with the English cast or the Japanese cast. I prefer Japanese games, set in Japan, to be played with their original voices, not dubs and I will always recommend it that way. Their voices fit well with their characters and if you played the original you'll feel right back at \"home\". The new cast also does a pretty great job at getting you emotionally invested. \n\nThe music is mostly from the original, which is of course, great, but there are some fantastic new tunes, especially the boss ones. As for the sound effects and everything else, all is good, no issues whatsoever. \n\nAudio rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nFor a console port, I can safely say it's a pretty good job. Not great, not perfect but still good considering this is the second Persona game on PC. It's still only locked to 60 FPS and there aren't that many graphical settings and as usual, the draw distances are weak but not much of an issue.  The game looks crisp in higher resolutions and details and combat effects and spells and whatnot are all nice to look at. \n\nThere are some crashes and it can be very annoying since there will be times where saving is very scarce and you just have to redo parts of the game or a long boss fight. Other than that, I have not encountered any other issues.\n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, then I don't think I can recommend Strikers but if you have there's absolutely no reason not to play it even if the gameplay is different. The characters you love are back and the story while similar in its beats, is still something nice to experience. \n\n[h1]Final score: 8/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Let me start by saying yes i do think this is a good game but it shouldn't be a 60$ game. Especially since almost everything is just reused assets from Persona 5. It's also not that great of a port either.\n\n- Random crashes \n- Broken Anti-Aliasing\n- No widescreen\n- Capped 60fps\n- Render distance is terrible there are a lot of object pop in's\n- Buggy cutscenes\n- Mouse sensetivity is screwed. You can either have the camera turn too fast or too slow. no inbetween.\n- Also the mouse camera movement feels broken at times\n- Mouse curser keeps appearing whenever there's a cutscene or a text box\n- Doesn't seem to fully utilize an SSD. Some loading take longer than they should.\n\nI repeat it's a good game. But it isn't worth 60$. If you wanna play it i recommend getting it for 40$ from a keysite or something. I'll change my review to a positive if the game actually fixed the issues above.",

Other than that if you like those musou games then you will enjoy this game but the adds actually can hit hard if you ignore them lol. My only complaint of the game is that it can easily just deteriorate to mashing the attack button and I don't know what i'm doing half the time. Maybe that will change after the third dungeon. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5/royal and wants more persona content and happens to like action rpg or musou elements. \n\nGameplay 8/10 \nMusic 10/10\nVisuals 9/10",

        "content": "After 36 hours in I can safely say that this is not the Persona 5 experience I was hoping to get. The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n",

And that a good thing. \nThe combat is fun and is solid musou action.\n\nthe world feels like a blend between musou and persona, open maps with parts to jump on or a city to explore and investigate. You wont get bored of the character interactions and when you enter the jail you can go where you want. Sneak up to a enemy and start the combat in a closed up environment that fixes the open musou combat from other Koei titles. Its more like a Jrpg.\n\nGraphics are great and the soundtrack is just phenominal. \nI have a lot of praise for this title and you should get it as fan of the series, Jrpgs or musou titles.\nits a perfect blend.\n\nNow sadly the game is not the best port. Long loading screens and sadly crashes.\nplus people having issues with fps and you cant play in full screen atm. (windowed works perfect).\n\nWith that said, i know they will fix it over time. And i'm here to review the game itself.\nIts a fantastic title.\n\nEnjoy the game !!",

        "content": "TDLR; Very fun gameplay but has only a decent story that gets the job done, has tedious grinding, and some pc port issues. \n\n\nBefore I start there're a few things I'd like to note. PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.",

        "content": "(Dungeon 5 issue fix below. I'll update when I finish the game to give my proper thoughts. Thanks for the help everyone ^^)\n\nNote: Explanation second paragraph !!!!\n\nFirstly, I want to say I've had a great time playing Strikers! While the combat can get repetitive, you'll never get tired of activating showtime, partner swap, or an all-out attack! The story (What I've been able to play) started a bit slow however picks up with great emotional scenes, bad-ass set pieces, and boss fights. I've enjoyed my stay up until now..... \n\nWe started with a few minor crashes, but was not too serious and only happened 3 times in my 47hr playthrough. Now though I am locked out of any story progression when completing the 5th jail. I can challenge the boss with no issue and win. When I finish the cut-scene afterwards, however, I am locked into an infinite loading black screen. I've tried multiple things and done the fight roughly 5 times now. I'm on Hard difficulty completing all side tasks and collecting all possible persona's my playthrough. Why's this important? because as of now I can't complete the game, making all the work up to this stage pointless...... \n\nPlease send suggestions to the discussion I've posted for other approaches and PLEASE FIX ATLUS/SEGA!!! I love this series and it hurts me to give an enjoyable game a negative review but I think this is the only way I can get my message across.",

        "content": "Sadly I can't recommend this at present.\n\nBut first, before getting to the very specific reasons why, some of the many positives:\n[list]\n[*]It's by far the best Warriors-type game out there. The idea to just fully remove the big mass combat maps sounds crazy and like it would completely break such a game, but it turns out it does just the opposite, it makes the combat able to use far more abilities and intricacies because there's only 20-30 enemies now, not 400-1000.\n[*]Persona 5 oozed style at every corner, and this carries the torch perfectly. Even the menus are - once again - overstylized to hell and back, the game is full of fancy animations, all fitting the theme.\n[*]Speaking of theme, wow the audio is even better than P5 or P5R. It really raises the bar for such games.\n[*]Combat is surprisingly challenging depending on difficulty chosen, because counters, interactions and avoidance have a lot of meaning and you can die in 2-3 hits if you use the wrong character at the wrong moment.\n[*]The story - as far as I can tell yet - is quite good, and easily blows anything any Warriors game has done before out of the water.\n[/list]\n\nSo, why no recommendation? Well, there's the problem that a significant amount of people experience quite frequent crashes to desktop. Sure, most games exhibit these for some hardware configurations but here it seems more that a majority see them, most people just rather rarely. And some people see them a lot. Also from reports around the web it seems those who have the accidentally released denuvoless version installed do [b]not[/b] suffer from these crashes. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is: You may want to hold off until they patch out Denuvo.",

        "content": "Bringing this game to Steam was a good move, but players really NEED the original Persona 5 or Royal first. Atlus should port that next to be fair. With that said:\n\nIf you're a Persona fan considering skipping this game because:\n\n1)It's not \"real Persona/Megaten\"\n2)It's not turn-based\n3)There is no Social Link/Dating mechanic\n4)It's not The Royal (Although please do not play this before at least vanilla P5)\n\n\nPLEASE reconsider. This is in every sense still a very Persona game.\n\n\nTo say this is not true Persona is the equivalent of saying Persona is not true SMT. They are in the same family and are loyal to the spirit of the series. P1 and P2 did not have social link too.\n\n\nTrust me when I say Atlus has gone to great lengths to ensure this game FEELS like a sequel to Persona 5.\n\n\nThis game is missing some elements which might disappoint Persona fans:\n\n-There is no social link/confidant\n-Persona fusions are extremely streamlined\n-The combat is (obviously) not turn-based\n-The calendar system is fully controlled by plot, nothing actually passes time\n-SP depletes SUPER fast in the early game, but after a couple dozen hours I've begun to appreciate spreading out skills cleverly with normal attacks and combos. Leaving the dungeon to regenerate has no time penalty but is a bit of a time waster, should just have an option to skip the animation entirely tbh\n\n\nDESPITE THIS:\n\n-There's an abundance of \"social-like\" events and cutscenes, they're just integrated into the plot\n-Some are actually optional and are nice breathers very loyal to Persona fashion. Some of these are also in the form of requests/sidequests.\n-There's also a Confidant-like system that applies only to the Phantom Thieves. It's mostly automatic but there are actions you can take to increase the rank further. Rather than 10 ranks with set bonuses, you gain points to invest in skills of your choosing\n-The Palaces (or \"Jails\") are pretty well designed from what I have played of them and are much longer compared to P5 to compensate for the shorter calendar. They are HUGE. Plenty of verticality in some parts and nice platforming.\n-Yes it's simplified, but fusions are still pretty fun and skill inheritance plays a role\n-BUFFS, buffs are still important in this game. If you're skilled you can chip away at bosses with low level.\n-The combat is stellar and definitely not a pushover, because the Persona menu stops time, it somehow still feels like Megaten, you're just not taking turns... Play the game on HARD if you have the guts for it, you'll feel like a boss when clutching bosses with 1HP left. A well prepared player can literally NUKE bosses without taking damage.\n-Being able to control all Phantom Thieves and swapping between them in combos feels great\n-There are many more areas to explore since this game covers a road trip, incuding P5's Shibuya\n-Early parts of each Jail kinda feel like Persona 4's Intel gathering segments, but here there's a percentage on screen so you know when there's actual progress (less guessing)\n\nIn the 4 days of early access (Pre-Order) I've had 2 crashes to desktop after a cutscene. It was very random and I barely had any other issue.\n\nTips (You can probably ignore this if you wanna go 100% blind but there's no story mentioned here):\n\n-FPS has 2 settings, 30 and 60fps, I believe you cannot unlock this.\n-If your computer can handle it, set the resolution scale to 2.0x or at least 1.5x. At 1.0 the game's antialiasing is nearly non-existant.\n-Use the tutorials menu! It's the only place you'll learn combos and they're **CRUCIAL**\n-Shops restock based on plot and battles too, not just the calendar! Always check when you return from the metaverse AND make sure you know what shops have what so you don't waste yen. (YES even the vending machine trash is VERY IMPORTANT in this game, mostly early tho)\n-Just like items are important, don't ignore cooking. It's very good.\n-Use BOND skillpoints wisely. Money and Shop Sale are very good, but all of them matter.\n-Upgrading the shop sale BOND skill will restock the shop, use this very wisely!\n-Revisiting Jails has value as the requests system makes a return",

        "content": "Looking cool, Joker!\n\nA really fun sequel to the original Persona 5, continuing the story 6 months after the original game, and mostly keeping up with the standards for story set by its predecessor, albeit retreading many of the same paths, leaving the plot extremely derivative of the original, though making up for that in strides with its characters!\n\nWith an action-based combat system similar to the Dynasty Warrior games, the classic Persona fusing mechanics, and a whole heap of style, the combat is a joy to experience, especially with each Phantom Thief bringing something unique to the table! \nDefinitely feeling a lot more like a Persona game than a Dynasty Warriors one.\n\nAlthough it is a shame that the social sim aspect of the original isn't present in this game, the cast and the story of this game is just as interesting! The story makes sure to show off the bonds the members of the Phantom Thieves have with each other, actually presenting them as a group of friends, something I feel the original was missing, and keeps much of the original presentation. Not quite reaching the same highs as the the original, but good nonetheless, carried almost entirely by its interesting and fun characters.\n\nUnfortunately the game comes with several technical issues. \nDue to the pandemic the English cast had to record their lines from home, and it really shows. While their performances are just as spectacular as in the original Persona 5, the audio quality and mixing is all over the place with certain lines being hardly audible, especially near the very beginning of the game, though it does get better and less noticeable as the game goes on.\nThe game also suffers from terrible aliasing and texture compression that makes it look like the image is built out of Minecraft blocks, and a faulty Anti-Aliasing solution that makes everything look smudged, including the text, which is a real shame because the UI and art of this game ooze style, just like Persona 5! The ability to increase render scaling does help to alleviate some of the issues, so marginally, the image quality can look better than on the PlayStation consoles.\nCoupled with a 60 FPS cap and no analogue movement support, makes this merely an OK port.\n\nThat is, [u][b]if the game works for you at all[/b][/u]. The version available for purchase right now is filled with many issues that directly inhibit your ability to play it. From infinite loading screens and constant crashes to just annoyingly long load times. With these severe issues seemingly being caused by the Denuvo DRM used for the game as the accidentally released DRM-Free version that came out with the Digital Deluxe edition pre-release suffers from none of these.\nAlthough users have found some supposed workarounds, the best way to fix this seems to be to somehow acquire the DRM-Free version of the executable.\n\nIf you are able to overcome the constant crashing and infinite loading times, the rest of these issues are easy to look past though with the fast paced action, charming characters, and the fun times you'll have with the Phantom Thieves in this sequel!\n\n[spoiler] Haru best girl.

I'm usually not a fan of Musou game, but this one actually includes a lot of the Persona 5 identity from the main game, and it's always a pleasure to meet the Phantom Thieves one more time !\nHowever, I can't recommend the game right now because of one single (big) issue : the random crashes. In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.",

        "content": "I've put a lot of hours into both Warriors games and Shin Megami Tensei games - and I enjoyed the original Persona 5, so I was excited to play Strikers. Now, having beaten the game, I can say that Strikers is one of the stronger games in its genre.\n\nThe gameplay of Strikers makes it a very enjoyable game. The game mixes the beat-em-up gameplay of Warriors games and the adventure gameplay of Persona, with some sprinkling of what feels like an Ys game. You'll progress through dungeons fighting Shadow after Shadow as the Phantom Thieves, and is what you'll spend most of your time doing. Each member of the Phantom Thieves have distinct skills and fighting styles, with my favorites being Inari's ice/counter and Noir's Psi/Gun fighting styles. This hasn't been the first time Persona has taken a step out of the comfort zone, and this game does it well. Unfortunately, this gameplay change also does away with the day-to-day life-sim aspect that Persona's iconic for in favor of a more linear schedule - time won't progress until you do the objective. This in turn removes the Confidant system (in favor of Bond XP leveling system), so any character-fleshing-out is going to only happen during the story. This isn't a huge turn-off for me, but for how much this game feels like just an action-Persona title, it's a shame that sort of thing wasn't included.\n\nStrikers is also very strong aesthetically. It hasn't changed much from Persona 5, but that isn't a bad thing. Exploring the dungeons, while admittedly formulaic at times, remains enjoyable over the 30 hour journey due to not only the enjoyable combat, but also due to varying environments and soundtrack. New songs add to the ambiance of dungeon exploration, while remixes of old Persona 5 favorites pumping energy into the combat. Like its predecessor, Strikers is very strong stylistically.\n\nFor better or for the worse, the story is very much what you would expect from an SMT game - [spoiler]  teenagers fighting ever stronger enemies until they kill god [/spoiler]. Still, I think the strongest parts of an SMT story is represented in its characters. While the Phantom Thieves have their time to shine, much more of the spotlight is given to new characters Sophia and Zenkichi, so it's a good thing these characters are likable.  I found Sophia to be very adorable and good comic relief, with Zenkichi being even stronger comic relief. It's a shame they get more of a focus than the original team, but they're well written enough to be enjoyable elements of the story.\n\nThis game is not standalone; I do not think you can play Strikers without expecting to be spoiled with the plot of Persona 5. Various plot elements of the previous game are talked about in Strikers - such as plot and ending elements of Persona 5, or retroactively spoil the original game - why are characters in the original game not in this one? If you're already familiar with the plot of the original or Royal or don't care about being spoiled, you can jump right in, but otherwise I cannot recommend this as the starting point of Persona 5 newcomers.\n\nThe one major gripe I have with Strikers is the sole technical issue I've had with the game - the crashes. Roughly during every session I play the game - after about two to four hours - the game will crash, usually during a transition between dungeons and Japan or traveling to/from the Velvet room. I save rather aggressively, so I basically never lost any progress, but if you're worried about that sort of thing and rely on autosaves you should probably wait for a future patch.\n\nTLDR: Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5, featuring charming characters, engaging combat, and a great aesthetic. Any fan of both of Persona and Warriors based combat is sure to enjoy this game, but people who haven't yet experienced Persona 5 or wary of crashes should purchase in the future instead.",

I won't say I enjoy the battles as much as in original entry, but I do feel more immersed in the battles (also, sometimes AI does some crazy shit and you must fight 1 vs boss, which I find quite confusing).  Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game. It would be VERY preferable to play Persona 5 Royal or Persona 5 before playing this to better understand the plot and how the game world works, but it's not on PC (yet?). \n\nP.S. This review is based in the first 10 hours of the game. I'll update it when I finish it",

While the Dynasty Warriors gameplay may be generic or old to some, to me, its something I played when i was really young so its something very special to me no matter how generic it may be. \nThe characters here feel the same as what they did in Persona 5 though a little more mature but still making them more unique from one another like Yusuke and Ryuji.

        "content": "NOTE: to those who may be stuck on the initial loading screens when opening the game: Hit Alt+Enter to change the game from Windowed Mode to Fullscreen, or vice versa. I found it worked for me.\n\nSome background. I've played P3FES, P4G, and P5 vanilla, and I was so excited for this game. However, If you're looking for an RPG experience like the typical persona games, you won't find it here. It is a more \"on the rails\" linear storyline. That being said, if you enjoy hack and slash gameplay or are invested in the characters, I can't reccomend the game enough. All the praises I could say about the game, you will likely hear from the others. What I do want to do is give some notes for those who are on the fence about the game/wonder about technicalities about the PC port.\n\nSome notes:\n       - As many have noted, this game has a LOT going on at once on your screen. The combat starting out will be clunky, stiff, and a bit challenging at first. You could say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this game. But give it some time and you'll eventually learn to filter out the noise and navigate battles like an expert. Making use of your dash and your special (Y button on the controller) will allow for some of the most fluid combat I've gotten a chance to play in a hack and lash.\n\n       - This game is an anti aliasing nightmare. If you can, before starting a new game, turn on anti aliasing and crank up the resoulution scale to 2.0. In classic persona fashion, you won't be able to access the pause menu until you get through the tutorials.\n\n        - This game is locked to 60fps. It's a real shame considering I wanted to make full use of my 144hz monitor, but we'll have to see if we'll get a community mod for that, or if it's set to 60 because the game logic will break because of a high framerate.\n\n        - The voice mixing in this game is kind of horrendous. Characters sound different (especially joker) and in some parts, voices are too quiet, like the VAs were standing too far away from the microphones. Still, this is an amazing feat considering that all of the voicework was recorded from home due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n        - The battles are fairly easy for me, and I've played only a few hack and slash's growing up. If you are a hack and slash expert, I'd put the difficulty on \"hard\". You are free to change the difficulty whenever you wish during the game.\n\n        -  There is a lot of reading, like traditional persona games. If you're not into that, you may want to give picking this up a second thought.  If you have never played Persona 5, I reccomend watching a playthrough or playing it yourself before jumping into this game as it does not give much background into the plot of P5.\n\nThis game is a whole lot of fun, and I want to thank the developers at Atlus for putting in the time to port this game to PC. Here's hoping for the other persona games to come to PC!",

Other than this the game runs perfectly smooth at 1080 and 60fps High without the need of a really powerful graphics card, so it's an easy buy if you have the recommended specs for it. Even during battle with a ton of enemies in the screen it never stuttered or lagged so you don't have to worry about its' perfomance.",

There were some minor issues upon first launching it but they disappeared after restarting. The default key bindings are also very disgusting, definitely change them before starting the game as you can not change them while playing on a save :/ I ended up locking myself in the tutorial mission because I had \"gun\" assigned to Tab and \"lock-on\" assigned to Alt...yeah you can probably see the problem there.\n\nOther than that, just like every Persona game the characters/soundtrack/story are amazing! It's a lot of fun being able to play as other characters aside from Joker. There's a fuck ton of new mechanics in this game compared to all the previous games so you will have plenty to do/work on.\n\nHowever...from what I heard there is one major downside to this game...[b]why can I not romance best girl Makoto?? or any character for that matter?[/b]",

        "content": "I came in to persona 5 strikers having played persona 5 (the original, not royal) and beaten it on a PS4. While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future. We're glad to have you here! \n\nBest Regards, -PR0XIDIAN",

        "content": "[h1]-Overall Opinion-[/h1]\n\nThis is genuine Persona DNA through and through, even though the combat system is different. If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

        "content": "As a fan of Persona 4 and 5, i cannot recommend this. Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored. If you like this kind of games - give it a shot.",

        "content": "The unexpected persona game to say the least but ATLUS did a very good job of keeping this game, well... still in the theme of Persona.\n\n[h1] Combat Mechanics [/h1]\nTo be simple, Turn-based JRPG turn Real-Time.\nA lot combat aspects are still there, surprisingly. Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.",

So when I heard that P5 was getting the musou treatment? I just had to buy it. All 29 hours I have so far, and I've only just begun the third dungeon. I love this game to death and will sing it's highest praises to anyone who will listen. My only gripe with it though is that it isn't musou enough for me, and the ambush mechanic seems a tad overpowered in this. A couple of friends have told me that bumping up the difficulty alleviates that some, but I can personally manage. I just wish we could of gotten tons of shadows on screen at once like you do in some fights instead of those you quickly ambush, push one button, and then instantly win the fight.",

        "content": "FIRST OF ALL A WARNING:\n[b]DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PERSONA 5 ALREADY AND ARE STILL PLANNING TO AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE! THIS GAME NOT ONLY CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, BUT ALSO BUILDS DIRECTLY ON THE PLOT OF P5 AND HEAVILY REFERENCES IT![/b]\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what a Persona Veteran and someone who's played through both P5 *and* P5R twice respectively, thinks of P5S so far:\n\nBiggest and most obvious change compared to the main series game is the combat system; instead of using the incredibly perfect turn-based combat approach from the main series, Strikers instead uses a realtime buttonmashing/Dynasty Warriors-ish kind of approach.\n\nWhen I first heard that, I was pretty disappointed, because Persona and turn-based just go hand in hand, and for very good reason.\n\nAfter having played it for myself, the first two hours or so I was still pretty on the fence, because it really was mostly button-mashing, and as I expected, the camera is a major hassle unless you lock on to a single enemy within a crowd of dozens.\n\nThe good news however is that it does get somewhat better over time, i.e. with story progress; you'll get environmental interactables that allow for special attacks, ranging from dashing onto a  lamp post to slide down with a wild spin-kicking tornado attack, to jumping on skateboards and just mowing down entire platoons of enemies, or even using stuff like oversized party poppers to bombard them from a distance.\nSo what the combat system lacks in tactical depth and detailed strategic combat gameplay, it reasonably makes up for in crazy and fun blowing-off-steam kind of combat escapades.\n\nAs for the story, it stays true to what we've seen in Persona 5, being a very well-written narrative with deeply emotional moments, philosophical questions, plot twists, as well as an overall theme that carries through 'til the end.\n\nI won't go into further details for obvious spoiler reasons, but suffice it to say that if you've loved P5's story, then'll you'll probably love P5:S's just the same, especially since the characters themselves reference a lot of the main storyline's key moments, and reminisce about the nostalgia of it all at pretty much the same time as you, the player, get that very same nostalgic feeling about encountering the main cast again.\n\nThe new members of the Phantom Thieves are also very intriguing and very well written (though one more so than the other, in my opinion), so look forward to discovering just what these two wil become over the course of the 25 - 35 hours of playtime.\nAll in all, this really feels much more like an addon to P5, story-wise, if not gameplay-wise, rather than \"just\" a spin-off.\n\nThere is some bad news too, however, namely in the [b]total lack of social/time management gameplay[/b] that is so typical of the Persona main series games.\nStrikers, sadly, is 100% linear, and fully scripted ... there's only one singular instance in the entire game where you can actually choose with whom to go on a ferris wheel ride, and that's it.\nNo romance, no confidants, nothing.\n\nThe same, equally sadly, goes for the Requests; compared to Persona 5 proper, in Strikers they are really, really uninspired, with 90+ percent consisting of generic fetch quests, or equally generic \"Kill X of Y in Z\" quests.\n\nAs I said (yelled from the rooftops :P) in the beginning, in my opinion, this game should only be played if you've already played through Persona 5 on console.\n\nIf you haven't yet, much of this game won't make much sense to you... you won't get any of the \"en passant\"-references, you won't really understand the major story references in highly emotional moments, and you don't even know the main cast at all, since Strikers doesn't bother to (re-)introduce them, instead expecting you to already know who they are, what they went through, how they became Phantom Thieves... you'd basically get thrown into a road trip of a group of extremely tight-knit friends whom you've never seen before in your life.\n\nAnd, again, the most important warning goes out to those of you who are still planning to play P5 eventually, maybe waiting for a potential PC release, or until they can afford console or game, or whatever:\n\n[b]Do _not_ play P5:S beforehand, it _will_ ruin large parts of the Persona 5 story and experience for you![/b]",

Character writing/voice acting is a real delight, the game's combat is a fantastic blend of action-RPGs (not unlike KH2 with its Reaction Commands) and the Persona series. It's not really in the same vein as FFVII Remake, but I like the combat system here for very similar reasons to that game. Compared to other Persona spin-offs in the past, this one for sure is a definite sequel through-and-through beyond the actual plot. If you've played the original before, this isn't worth missing out on.\n\nalso sophia is adorable and i care for her",

The only complaint, if any is that the camera could've used a little more work but the counter to that is a lovable/colorful cast, fun battle system, and fun side indulgences like cooking (I do love my cooking mechanics). Honestly, not the most in-depth review but for someone who has entered the P5 universe with this game, I am having a lot of fun; definitely recommended!",

        "content": "Wow, So, you get THE TEAM. You know? THE TEAM! Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it. They tried to merge two different worlds and ending failing both of them. Which is sad cause i really do love these phantom thieves.\n\nThanks & Good Luck\n\n",

        "content": "Game is good, first time I've found the musou genre vaguely compelling! Port is rubbish: 3 to 4 minutes to start the game every time (as in, staring at a black screen for said several minutes before even the LOADING ICON appears), long load times during the game proper (15 to 20 seconds), which according to some sites: apparently stem from having installed DLC and Digital Deluxe Content. So don't buy those if you want manageable load times. In my case though, loading is still exactly as slow even after removing the DLC and uninstalling from HDD reinstalling the game unto my SSD. \n\nOn a whim, I heard that downgrading the drivers to your video card might help matters, so I decided to log into GeForce Experience; and before I started downgrading I started up the game and this time the game loaded in TEN SECONDS! Excited, I exited the game and started it again, hoping that solved the problem but nope. It was back up to 3 to 4 minutes of black screen before the game loaded again. What the hell? What the ACTUAL hell? Everything was literally the same when I started the game both those times in that short span of time. Why.\n\nI'm not the only one with this problem, and there are many others with various issues regarding crashing after long dungeons and the like. These issues/bugs may be address by a patch in the future but for right now: literally play any other version of Persona 5 Strikers instead of this one.",

        "content": "A great sequel to Persona 5, and one of the best games the musou subgenre has to offer. P5\u2019s stylish and bold aesthetic perfectly mixes well with the musou genre. The Phantom Thieves\u2019 attacks are consistent to their original kit and are fluid. The new showtime attacks look awesome and are satisfying to use when facing a large enemy mob. Persona skills are still available and give you some time to breath during a battle, maintaining some of the turn-based mechanics from the original game. I feel more encouraged to switch between party members in this game since all of them have much higher utility in this game compared to the original game, where I would have a set party for a majority of the game. The persona elements help make the game feel less repetitive in combat since there\u2019s plenty of combos, abilities, and party members to try and use, which is a problem that plagues games in this subgenre.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves finally get some quality time together as they traverse across Japan to, which was much needed in the original game (looking at you Haru). There are plenty of moments during this road trip for fans of the game to enjoy. Zenkichi and Sophia are awesome additions to the main cast and have some of the most compelling character arcs in Persona 5. Villains in this game are more sympathetic than their P5 counterparts since most villains in Strikers were originally well-intentioned people before being twisted due to certain events. It\u2019s a welcome change.\nThe lack of social links is disappointing. Confidant abilities get replaced with bond skills that are useful, but very grindy to accumulate the points to maximize the skills without the dynamic building between Joker and the confidant. Most of the cast from P5 are nowhere to be referenced, which kinda sucks. I would\u2019ve at least liked the cast to mention how some of the side characters were spending their time in this game as a fan, but it\u2019s ultimately a neutral exclusion.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a game I\u2019d highly recommend to people who played Persona 5/Royal. Fans would enjoy seeing the Phantom thieves enjoy their quasi-summer vacation and more moments from their favorite members. Would I recommend it to people who have not played Persona 5 or Royal? Probably not since it\u2019s a direct sequel, but gameplay wise, it\u2019s one of the best musou games for sure.",

        "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.",

        "content": "[h1]This game is Amazing but not without flaws ( well the flaws are more due to the port and not the game itself )[/h1]\n\n[b]Persona 5 Strikers shows that Musou can still feel fresh and that Atlus is not done suprising us.[/b]\n\n[h1]The gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is basically a mix between Musou ( Warriors ) style games ( Dynasty warriors, one piece pirate warriors etc. ) and the core formula of Shin Megami Tensei / Persona.\n\nYou'll have your basic Musou combos by combining \u25a3 and \u25b3 and in addition to that you can use your Persona and their abilities. \nThe gameplay may seem pretty basic at first but when you start facing strong enemies on higher difficulties you will need to switch between your Persona to have the right resistance against the attack you're about to receive, switch to a Persona that can exploit the enemy weakness, use \"technical skills\" by inflicting a status ailment on the enemy and then using a skill that benefits from that ailment etc.\n\nDuring your fights you'll be able to use your environment to attack your enemies in different way as well as dodge incoming attacks. Certain bosses have special interactions with some of these environmental attacks, but i wont spoil anything there you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nIn contrary to a standard Musou game you don't have zones to capture, it's closer to Persona in the fact that you engage a shadow and a group of enemy spawn ( of course you can ambush them like in Persona 5 ).\n\nThe bosses are pretty fun but they are sponges, they have a lot of hp and the fights can get a bit long ( but Persona has the same problem ).\n\nThe palaces are not very memorable and some of them are downright annoying.\n\nI recommend progressing through the game on max difficulty so you can actually see and use all the mechanics it has to offer and only use the Easy difficulty when you have to grind because some things take forever to get ( for example bond level in the post game ).\n\n[h1]The story and the characters[/h1]\nThe story is decent, it's not as good as a mainline entry but it's good enough to get you hooked.\nYou'll follow the Phantom thieves on a trip to different Japanese cities to clear their palaces ( called Jails in the game ), the interactions with the other characters are fun but you wont have the depth of other Persona games and their social links because this mechanic is not in the game, it's replaced by a general bond level which you gain points for by fighting, doing certain quests and spending time with the characters. ( yes this means you can't romance futaba the best girl )\n\nThe characters include the ones we all know and love from Persona 5 and it's nice to spend some time with them again.\nThe new characters are also nice and pretty well written .\n\nthe antagonists, their story and motives are decent.\n\n[h1]The art[/h1]\nThe game looks just like Persona 5 so i don't have too much to say about that, if you like the graphical style of P5 you'll love Strikers'.\nThe animations are nice and fluid and every character has different animations inside and outside of combat.\nThe all out attacks and Showtime are nice and flashy and different between each characters.\n\n[h1]The soundtrack[/h1]\nThe Japanese voice acting is very good ( i didn't try the english one ).\nThe musics are by the same singer as Persona 5's musics and they are really freakin' good. Some are subjectively better than what we got in Persona 5 such as What You Wish For or Daredevil.\nThe sounds in the fights are similar to what we've seen in Persona 5, down to when Joker calls a persona.\n\n[h1]How long to beat ?[/h1]\nStrikers is much shorter than the other Persona entries, in 43.4Hrs in beat the game once in Hard difficulty and once on Merciless in NG+. I've read all the text, participated in all the events i could, finished the inmate registry and got all the success on Steam.\nThis doesn't make it worse than other entries, if you were not a fan of how much Slice of Life stuff there was in other Persona games you'll prefer the direction of Strikers, there's still filler stuff but it's way more focused on the story and gameplay.\n\n[h1]My main complaints with the game[/h1]\nAt its current state the game sometimes crashes during loadings ( i got about 10 crashes in my playtime which is not a lot but it's still annoying, especially after a hard fight )\n\nFarming bond experience is a pain in the ass, it takes forever if you don't use exploits.\nKeep in mind that you can use an exploit to \"bypass\" the bond experience issue and i did use it.\nFarming Persona Points to level up your Persona is also really annoying, it's not hard because you just have to unsummon a persona and resummon it from the registry over and over but the process is really long and boring, even with the Persona that give the most points.\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nIf you have played and enjoyed Persona 5, go for it without thinking, except if you hate action-rpg. You'll have a blast.\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, i'd say to play it first because in Strikers they don't introduce the characters that are from regular P5, they assume you already know them. Also they reference some events that took place in P5.\n\n[h1]Any plans for Persona 3 FES and Persona 5 Royal atlus ?[/h1]",

        "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5",

I thought it would be like the other Dynasty Warriors games (Hyrule Warriors for example) but boy am I wrong do I love the gameplay. It really blends in classic Persona elements with action fighting mechanics from Dynasty Warriors and it works really well that you can have a lot of fun with the gameplay and use it to your advantage during boss fights and all. \n\nNow if only Atlus releases Persona 5 Royal on Steam I would be a happy man. But this game is still worth buying for sure!",

Definitely worth your money :)",

        "content": "After playing for a while I can say that it's definitely more like a sequel than a spin-off. The sim life is indeed less present, but the charms of the characters still shine the same. The combat is fine, but the game doesn't blow me away like the original (and certainly Royal) did, but it is certainly entertaining enough. Indeed, it's worthy of calling it a Persona 5 sequel rather than a spin-off as the story literally picks up where the original ended and it feels like a warm homecoming (literally) from digital friends you've been missing.\n\nIt is great that another studio manages to capture Persona 5's style so well, even though it is a lot less in-depth. For example, I liked the sim-life part of Persona 5 the most and the turn-based combat a bit less. Although I normally prefer action-based combat, I liked the combat better in the original as it feels a bit messy in Strikers. The attacks don't really feel they have a lot of impact and your super attacks (like in the original) deal the most damage. But they cost a lot of SP, but this may become a bit more balanced if you get a little further in the game and have collected more upgrades.\n\nDespite the sequel being 'not as good' as the original, it certainly doesn't make it bad. The charm of Persona 5 is just as strong and the combat is entertaining enough. Despite the fact that the sim-life aspect is less present, it is fortunately still somewhat there. But to see your friends with the same great voice actors just feels good and it is very entertaining to go on an adventure together again.\n\nI wanted to share my opinion about it, but I have to say it keeps getting better. Even though I've been playing for a couple of days, I'm taking it easy and I've finished only the first chapter by now and recently started on the second one. But I can certainly say this. For those who've played Persona 5 and are absolutely craving more, here's your sequel that's definitely worthy of it.",

        "content": "Ever since I played vanilla persona 5 about 2 years ago, I've been sucked into this series and have loved every second of it. As a big fan, seeing strikers get a PC port meant more persona on PC and an instant buy from me. As expected, I am not disappointed. This combat, while it does take a while to master, is extremely addicting and is the highlight of the game so far for me. The story is entertaining as well, and travelling across a bunch of cities with the gang is a vibe. As this is the first game in the P5 universe on steam, playing it just really makes me want Persona 5 Royal on steam that much more. Seeing my favorite game get the port that everyone has been begging for would really be like a dream.  As for this game, if you're a fan its a must buy, but for others you do need to play vanilla persona 5 to understand anything in this game.",

There are a lot of mechanics and features that make it really feel like a worthy extension of Persona 5, and it of course oozes all of the style and flair that we loved about the original.",

The main game of Persona 5 will need to be played to understand the world, but this is nothing but a benefit since the game doesn't need to waste any time exploring the old cast. The story is very fun, the new characters are very welcome additions, the gameplay is addictive, and the soundtrack of course is godly. I can't recommend this enough to anybody who even slightly enjoyed Persona 5.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.",

        "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5. The world needs more Persona games.",

        "content": "Please look up an AA fix before playing the game!\n\nThe AA in the game will make your text blurry, and not playing with AA makes characters in the near-distant VERY jaggy and unappealing alongside VERY jaggy text boxes (which wriggle about as you read). Tweaking it in the nVidia control panel fixes it completely and makes the game a wonder on the eyes. It's a shame that it has to be done, though, since that probably means the port quality is scrappier than I would've liked, but at least it's a relatively small and easy thing to tweak.\n\nOtherwise, the game's pretty solid so far. I'm surprised at how \"Persona\" it is, since I was certain that it was gonna be a Warriors game, with stages and missions, that just happens to have a Persona skin. Much to my surprise, it's not. I mean, it's certainly a Warriors' game, but not a 1:1 skin.\n\nEDIT: Also, remake Persona 3 and put it on PC pls.",

The menu screens, transitions, animations are all amazing.\n3. The fight scenes feel very fluid while sticking to the Persona game theme very well. \n4. The story, this might be a personal preference, but I really do love the story. \n5. Mechanical skills and awareness feels rewarding. Dodging at the right time, using the right abilities on the right targets at the right time, it all rewards you in spades.\n\nI have some pet peeves with the game, albeit not enough to stop me from enjoying the game. \n1. The jagged lines and horrendous AA implementation kind of bothers me at times\n2. I can't find as many sort orders as the other games, kind of makes things harder to search for, when you want to search for a specific persona.\n3. Not sure if this is a bug, but there one time when two of the AI controlled members just flat out AFK'd mid fight. And then the other used abilities repeatedly which kinda sorta just healed the shadows. Forcing me to fight in a different way. (It happened just once to my knowledge and hasn't happened ever since, still, always in the back of my mind.)\n\n\nTL;DR, My grading for P5S\nVisuals          9/10  -  The game is a literal piece of art\nMusic            9/10  -  Some of the best game scores you can find \nCharacters    9/10  -  They will end up as a part of you. \nGameplay     8/10  -  Enjoyable\nStory             8/10  -  Engaging",

        "content": "Tl;dr: Great game, not just a Musou clone, well worth checking out.\n\nA worthy successor to Persona 5 and highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the original.\n\nRight out the gate, it's important to note that this is a rather different game to Persona 5 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The fighting got a new dynamic to it, and is entertaining throughout the whole game. \n\nNow the negatives:\n-The gameplay is a bit tedious. (Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it. Not the perfect game, but worth it non the less. I reccomend you to play the base game quickly (with it's 150 hours of gameplay :D) before buying this game, so the story fascinates you even more.",

        "content": "While this game's combat mechanics are fun and fresh in their divergence from Persona's normal turn-based gameplay, the story (while it has its moments) is a boring retread of material from past Persona games, and apart from the fanservice for players of Persona 5 I can't recommend this game on the merits of its narrative. The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat.\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively. Aight yall be good people and WEAR YO MASK!",

Sure, there are still mindless waves of fodders for you to smash them away, but they also implement tactical RPG stuff really nicely. You will find yourself planning the fight surprisingly a lot more than that. Most systems from Persona series are coming back and fit in really nicely (Elemental weakness, One-more, All-out-attack, Showtime.) It feels not out of place and keep it very true to the lore of Persona 5 in every aspect from gameplay, design, theme, and world's logic.\n\nOne thing that can be see as a downside is P5S is the direct continuation of Persona 5 (with some references to P5R too.) And it's not a small side story but pretty much a full fledged saga. They do try to rush out some of quick recap in the first hour but people without experience of  Persona 5 can find this sudden insertion to technical stuff too absurd for them. Is it needed? Not really. But your reaction would be \"Oh! I remember that! Nice!\" every thirty seconds to \"WTF just happened?\" based on your exposure to Persona franchise. Still a great game, but ATLUS and SEGA should really considered boosting this game with the Persona 5 Royal release on PC.",

        "content": "Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei by extension, have a pretty sizeable barrier to entry when it comes to engaging players. Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you. Whether that itch is worth scratching is up for you to decide.",

I would NOT recommend it if you haven't played Persona 5 for two reasons: 1. The game is a sequel to P5 so you wont really get most of the references or relationships. And 2. PERSONA 5 IS AMAZING AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT PLAYING IT. All jokes aside, this game is really fun, once you get into the flow of combat, it is really enjoyable. It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.",

        "content": "10/10 game, now keep it up and bring of the Persona franchise to PC.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a step in a brand new direction for the entire Persona franchise, yet entirely fits all of the knowledge we currently have on the series. Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.",

        "content": "I've logged over 160 hours into Persona 5, it's in my top 3 favourite games. It's so cool to see a direct sequel with a similar concept. It's very fun to see this game take place in an action Musou format rather than an RPG. It kind of adds to the immersion in a way. Super charming to see the gang back together stealing twisted desires. Something I appreciate about this game is that it's not *just* a Warriors game, but it really feels like a bite sized Persona game with the life sim mechanics. Persona on PC in general is eye candy and super convenient to just boot up since I'm usually using my computer every day.",

        "content": "I haven't met many people in recent years who hadn't heard of Persona 5 in some fashion. Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus. Well done, Omega Force.",

        "content": "I would give this a neutral review if I could and rate it a generous 3/5. It isn't bad but it also does nothing good. This is a spin off of the original Persona 5 release and really only performs well at giving more screen time to the cast. You could play this without first playing Persona 5 but it would be pretty pointless. The story isn't that good and neither is the gameplay. You are here for the cast you wouldn't even know. This also does not follow Persona Royal and the new character from that version is not here.\n\nNone of the side characters from Persona 5 are in the game outside of Sojiro at the very start and end of the game. None of your favorites from the social links return at best you might get one line of internal monologue from Joker acknowledging their existence. One other character does show up for maybe 10 lines and that's it. \n\nSocial links themselves do not exist. Bonding points are here which you can use to level up skills that unlock during the main story. It's basically just a bar that goes up from pretty much anything you do without the main reason we did social links in the first place. Romance does not happen here but there are two bonding points in the game. But they are quickly forgotten and never mentioned again. \n\nThe story is average at best. Basically a rework of Persona 5 with more changing of hearts. If you've ever played a JRPG or watched anime you likely can see where it is going. Entirely forgettable and just an excuse to bring the cast back together. This could be more forgiven if the gameplay was great but...\n\nThe Shin Megami Tensei series perfected turn based combat many years ago with the Press Turn system. Persona 5 being an actual spin off of the main series uses a modified system of it. Strikers throws out all of that for an action system combined with musou elements. The main issue is it is incredibly repetitive and gets boring quickly. Each character has a few basic combos, their gun and their persona abilities. They also each learn 4 arts from continuing to use them further making them more useful and unique. But the kicker is you are now using all this up against the musou style of gameplay with tons of waves of enemies. It starts interesting but quickly overstays its welcome. Regular mobs are fairly weak but mini and especially bosses are HP sponges. The weakness abuse/critical hits/technical hits all carries over but it just isn't much fun. After the second jail I lowered the difficulty from hard to easy just so I could see the story.\n\nThere are two new characters joining the cast. Both fit in nicely and enjoyed their dialogue during the story. They are even better in combat though. I would say they might be to good and you might not want to leave them out in favor of your past favorites.\n\nThere is no time management in this game so you can freely leave the dungeon at any point. But it is like no one bothered to play test the game. You can leave from any checkpoint to restore your HP/SP and even warp back to that same point. So why not just make the checkpoint restore these things without wasting our time leaving and coming back? SP itself is scarce at the start of the game. The further you go in the main story the more bond skills you unlock to increase ways of restoring it. But it should just naturally recover from using normal attacks.\n\nThe voice acting (Japanese at least) is great and so is the music. Several music remixes and I look forward to getting the OST. The game is just as stylish as Persona 5 from menus to the actual combat.\n\nThe PC port is not that great. I myself had three crashes in my near 32 hours but I hear some people had it way worse. The graphical options are bugged and you'd need to tweak them outside of the game. Also the game is locked at a max 60 fps but the cutscenes run at 30 fps which is very noticeable.",

        "content": "[h1] Persona 5 Strikers completed review [/h1]\n\n[h1] Disclaimer [/h1]\nThis is not a spin-off of Persona 5, this is a sequel. For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b]. HEE-HO!",

I loved the story, the characters old and new, the English voice acting which I am so glad Atlus waited until the English cast finished their recording despite the pandemic (Taylor Harvey playing persona 5 strikers\u2019s Sophie is such a great fit).  Finally the message Persona 5 strikers delivers. From the start I had worries of it being very slow pace due to how it set up. But once it kicks in. Oh it kicks in all right.  \n\nAs for the gameplay. For me personally the warriors style game play does get a bit repetitive during the ending just spamming magic and just using sp items to do more magic rinse and repeat but as a Dynasty Warriors fan. It\u2019s just so much fun. I really enjoyed it and would recommend those who are fans of persona to try it out or those who are interested in the warriors famoula (just a warning might want to start on hard since normal feels far too easy). Sure it\u2019s not your jrpg but for the plot and message it brings. Persona 5 Strikers is really worth the pick up. \n\nFinished it with all achievement done and would do it again. I might just come back for it for a merciless run but as of right now the show\u2019s over \ud83d\ude0a highly recommend. Thanks, you Koei, Omega Force, Sega and Atlus for bringing such a masterpiece over to the west.  Now where is my persona 5 strikers 2 because I crave please, persona 4 or 3 strikers anyone?",

        "content": "It's quite excellent.\n\nIf you really enjoyed Persona 5, you probably already picked this up.  If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is still Persona, but instead of Turn based you get Warriors-style hack-n-slash battles. Atlus and Koei really made this game work amazingly, perfectly translating the persona 5 battles into warriors style. The game just as stylish and the writing is just as good, if not better then Royals. All the new music and remixs feel great and unique while still feeling the same. Although the game has some issues running on PC, it still runs well enough to play. The Digital Deluxe in-game DLC I find really adds to the game having the older music from the series' past. Although the Deluxe's bonus content is just a unity project, which means you don't get the soundtrack directly as music files. Atlus actually updating this game on PC to make it more stable is great, just wish they'd fix the optimization issues it has.",

        "content": "I absolutely fully recommend this game, it's a fun and great sequel to the original Persona 5 and I can tell you, you'll have a blast. Sure, the combat is different from the original but I promise you, if anything, the change is nice. \nThis game still has an absolute bunch of story and cutscenes for you to enjoy, just like the original game. I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be very story driven and expected much more of a dynasty warrior style all the way through, I'm glad I was wrong on that one though. While I recommend playing/watching the original Persona 5, you can still play this game without knowing it, you'll just be a little confused or oblivious to some references.\nI'd say if you want just story, it's about 30-ish hours but to complete it (achievements, etc.) would be more like 50. Less content than in the original, but expected.\nThe new characters that are introduced fit the team perfectly and I really like how every single member has their own unique way of fighting, it's fun to change it up here and there. One of my favourite parts is that you can play as any of the cast (you'll always be Akiren/Joker for the social stuff and for main story, though) and they all have their own unique animations and cutscenes, it's just a whole lot of fun all the way through.\nI am the same as everyone else hoping that Atlas decide to port P5/P5R to steam, but for now, this is a really nice way to scratch the itch for Persona players and fans alike.",

        "content": "So, how do I start with this review?\nHalf an hour ago, after 60 hours of playing I finally finished P5Strikers and I am blown away. I LOVED P5 on the PlayStation 4 (didn't play P5R yet, ATLUS, PLS BRING IT ON PC, I BEG YOU) and I do love P5Strikers even more, kinda. Although I couldn't build my romance-ship with Futaba, like in P5...\n\nThe gameplay is in my opinion not just like a normal ''Warriors''-Hack and Slash-kinda gameplay, it is basically a combination of using your Persona-Skills correctly or in the right situation and more or less just smashing your 2 attack-buttons. For those, who like the ''Warriors''-games, you will DEFINITELY love this piece of indescribable and beautiful art. The ''Hack and Slash''-Combat doesn't feel boring nor repetitive, like in the original ''Warriors''-series, which is because of the HUGE variety of Personas you can have (just like in the original P5) and how ATLUS/Koei Tecmo/Omega-Force integrated the usage of the Personas, is just awesome.\n\nThe story is just awesome. No worries, I won't say ANYTHING about the story. It plays half a year after the story of P5 and  has a lot of moments, where it brings you to almost crying, but it can INSTANTLY change your sad mood into a very happy mood, because of a sudden joke or such little things, which make the story, the characters and their bond just absolutely amazing and wonderful. Speaking of the characters, each of the already known Phantom Thieves and all of the new characters newly introduced to this story are completely well written, each has their own little ''story'' and ''highlight'' in this game - Atlus, you are just amazing in writing characters and stories for your games.\n\nWhat else can I say? I am again cmpletely amazed because of an Atlus-game, which isn't anything special, because, as I've said, Atlus is absolutely A M A Z I N G in writing stories + characters.\n\nEvery city, that you will see is individually designed, nothing looks like the other, the Meta-Verse is truly amazing designed, the bosses all have great designs and I can not stop simping about this game (or Futaba, heh).\n\nI hope for everyone, who will read this, that I could help you a little bit, if you have troubles, buying this game, because you needed a second opinion. <3\n\nOh, two things left....\n1. FUTABA IS WAIFU, FUTABA FOR LAIFU <3\n\n2. ATLUS - PLEASE - PERSONA 5 ROYAL FOR PC AND MAKE AGAIN A SEQUEL FOR THE BEST PHANTOM THIEVES ON THE EARTH!!!!!\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my bad english, couldn't decide, if I should write this review on English or German, so yeah xD",

I don't want to go into full detail on how much I like this game, (because I'm not an anime person) but, all I can say is, that this game is really frickin' great. It has some tense moments, a lot of happy moments, and a lot of heart-pulling moments. I swear I actually cried when the game was over- and considering this was my first game to play in the series, I'm hoping that there will be way more! Great job Atlus. I'll be waiting for the next pc port!",

I was more eager to catch up with my friends and fellow Phantom Thieves: Ann, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba, Haru, Morgana \u2014 even Ryuji. Though only six months had passed for them since we attacked and dethroned god, I hadn\u2019t properly spent time with our ragtag group in three years (barring one weird dancing fever dream).

Lots of fun cutscenes and nice visuals (The usual trippy craziness that Shin Megami Tensei is famous for) really made it enjoyable.\n\nThe only con I see is the real world and choice elements. Most of the time choices are completely pointless since all of them lead to the same result and are utterly meaningless.  Don't expect much from this particular aspect of the game and just focus on the story itself, you'll have more fun by treating it as what it really is, a side-story in the same universe as the original P5.",

        "content": "First of all I want to stress one thing. If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.",

        "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself. So far I am really enjoying myself. I love how it does feel like a sequal to persona 5( Although I wish is was a sequal to Royal.) I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.",

        "content": "Honestly I'm not a huge fan of musou combat, but there's so much more to this game and the combat is decently well-done, just takes some getting used to coming from your mainline Persona games. If you liked Persona 5, you'll like this too because it's essentially more P5. Stylish, fun team interactions, great music, a decent story (especially for a spin-off), and just the all-around polish that I've come to expect. My main takeaway from this and the fact that the SMT Nocturne Remaster is coming to Steam (announced yesterday as of writing this) is that Atlus is on PC to stay, and that's what I really love about this. These games coming to PC means that P4G made them realize they can print money by giving games to people on the platform they want, and I'm all for it.",

        "content": "If you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona you enjoy the game. I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything. And frame rate randomly drops. I have a 3090 playing between 1080p and 1440p.",

The soundtrack is incredible, the story felt more impactful and it got me so hooked ever since the 4th jail. The ending was beautiful and the graphics were just stunning at times. It makes me so happy to see how far persona has come and it is by far my favorite game series. This game is worth the 60 dollars completely. I wouldn't even hesitate  to play it again.  I really hope Persona continues to grow as a series and reach more people as it really is special.",

        "content": "A direct sequel to the incredible Persona 5. The main star is an awesome action combat system that is extremely faithful to the trademark Persona JRPG combat mechanics. Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n",

        "content": "Bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam! Okay, now that that obligation is done, here's an actual review.\n\nDisclaimer: At time of writing, this game has weird issues on PC. You should play in either borderless window or windowed mode in general to reduce load times. I had this installed on an SSD and when it ran in full screen it took a solid 30 seconds to a minute to load while in the bordered modes took about 5 seconds. Not to mention if you do play fullscreen you'll frequently get stuck in loading screens. This occurred when playing in windowed for me a few times as well so it's still a toss-up if you lose progress or not. Unfortunately, this happened most frequently after big boss fights for me and was very frustrating. Running in administrator mode seems to help with these issues as well but this game really needs some patches.\n\nStrikers was a surprise. I happened to be finish Royal the day that Strikers released and was eager to return to the world of Persona 5. As much as I find that Musou are not to my taste, this game really hit the right nerve. It tries to adapt the strengths of Persona to a Musou format and achieves this fairly well. It's still a button masher but each character controls differently from one another and being able to swap between 4 party members on the fly is a nice feature. The game is just as stylistic and flashy as the original P5 with a hard-rock twist to the original's already amazing soundtrack.\n\nThe story itself is fairly lighthearted especially compared to P5 and Royal. Strikers is a road trip video game which is something we don't see often and made me immediately fall in love with this tone. The characters are generally having more fun and surprisingly the English voice acting for Strikers might be better than P5 or Royal. Characters feel more expressive and emotive and I laughed a lot more at this game than the previous entry. The story does go towards a direction I didn't like at the end by retreading themes you've seen before but overall, I did enjoy it even if it is entirely unnecessary.\n\nOverall, a fun time and a worthwhile, albeit unnecessary, follow-up to Persona 5. If you can deal with the issues I mentioned and are looking for a charming and lighter return to the Phantom Thieves, this road trip across Japan is a solid recommendation.",

        "content": "Boy howdy, these Musou Games are getting pretty sophisticated. This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.",

No crashes at all on an Intel CPU even after beating the 4th Jail. The combat is so exploitable it's almost like it wasn't tested much, yet at the same time the freedom to do whatever is nice.\n\nIf you have an AMD CPU, save frequently, and maybe consider getting the game once it goes on a discount. If patches are released in the future, this could change.",

        "content": "As someone with 400+ hours in the original Persona 5 game, I can say without a doubt that this is a worthy spin-off. The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it. I recommend this game especially if you loved P4G and P5/P5R. \n\nAnd of course, I, like everyone else, look forward to the inevitable Persona 3 and Persona 5 Royal PC port.",

The game is aware of this somewhat, and it does come up as a joke that this is incredibly similar to what the thieves has already experienced.\n\nIf you like Persona 5 in any way, I would strongly recommend this game, just remember to save often as the game tends to crash on me randomly",

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers. Look foreword to it.\n\nI was glad to hang out with these weird kids in japan again, and I was not disappointed.",

        "content": "A fun muso game with a familiar cast and world with the same staples Persona 5 is known for such as it's great sound track and its style is also faithful. Combat is enjoyable and the way combos expand the more you play as each character is a good way to get you playing everyone and seeing each thief's arsenal while in combat. I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less. It is not a great port over onto PC and with these issues being so irregular, be prepared to what you could end up dealing with.",

I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt's getting a negative review from me after 20+ hours because the people who are being fucked over by the constant problems the game has deserve a voice.\n\nThis game has a ton of issues when it runs for many users; I had the issues up until I forced the game to run in Administrator mode, and that literally fixed all of my problems. I haven't had a crash since day 1; on Day 1, I had three crashes. I found the suggestion from a user who had tried making sure the game ran in Administrator and it fixed all of their issues.\n\nI have friends suggesting that the Kyoto boss area is basically unwinnable right now, and it has a crash right after that you can't get past. I'm looking to try and see if that happens to me, as I'm a few in-game days away from that particular date.\n\nThis game is great, the port itself needs some tweaks, but apparently Atlus nor Koei Tecmo plan to do shit about it.\n\nI've lost a lot of respect for Atlus, and now I'm not sure if they deserve any more of my money past this point; Persona 4 Golden was a beautiful port, and it was patched with the majority of its issues solved within days.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks from this game's release and not a fucking word of anything getting changed or improving. Dev's want to sweep this under the rug and get away with it.\n\nIf you can, and you also reviewed this game, swap it to negative and get this game noticed by the Dev's so they do something.",

        "content": "I genuinely really like this game. It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.",

        "content": "This game is amazing!\nA must if you played the original Persona 5 or Royal. While I initially had my doubts and worried this would be just a Musou-kind cash grab, it feels a lot more like Persona 5-2 would be like. The quirky characters, the second to none soundtrack and having a peek at more cities in Japan are all super enjoyable. If you've been to Japan, you'll immediately recognize Kyoto, Osaka, Okinawa and many more locations!\n\nThe battle system can be a bit tricky in the beginning (and very lengthy towards later bosses), but it rewards skills and planning, which is an additional metric to perceive progress in the game.\n\nDuring my playthrough, the game only crashed once. I lost 15 minutes of progress, so make sure you'll save at every opportunity you have just in case.\n\nI only feel sorry that this is a game that can be only fully appreciated by gamers who played Persona 5, it's sad that there is no port available just yet. \n\nDefinitely recommended!",

        "content": "This game is great (I have not beat it, im up to the final \"act\") If you enjoy dynasty warriors combat and love the world of persona 5 then this is the game you didnt know you needed. For those who have not played baseline Persona 5 I would heavily recommend you do so before playing this game. P5S feels great to be back into the world of Persona alone let alone the refreshing combat that gives it a new feel and twist. The characters are the same lovable idiots we grew with through P5 and seeing them again is awesome, added with a few new people and its a fantastic dynamic. If you have played any other persona game you know the music is great and the way they personas work in this new combat feels natural. \n\nPS: Hard mode is really hard at the start and well worth the challenge if your like me and hate yourself\n\nEdit: 45 hours and I finished the game, 9.5/10 I bought it for 75$ and id happily spend that again",

[spoiler] Meaning Kasumi does not exist in this game, Atlus please add her as a DLC later maybe. :) [/spoiler] With a new threat posing the world, the thieves are reunited together to kick some more ass.\n\n[b]Persona 5: Strikers[/b] introduces a new hack-and-slash combat system to give the series a fresh take. As Atlus always delivers, there is also incredible UI transitions, music compositions, and stories to explore in the world. By buying the Deluxe Edition, you will be granted access to the digital interactive artbook, soundtrack, and some behind-the-scenes making of Striker's music- on top of that, you will also receive some bonuses in-game to aid you in your battles.\n\n[spoiler] SPOILER ALERTS: Do NOT peek at the artbook until you're finished with the game, the artbook contains spoilers. The opening cinematic to the game also contains a tiny portion of spoilers, in case you're wondering about that. [/spoiler]\n\nThis game will have you traveling across several cities and towns based in Japan. You will meet new faces, discover hidden treasures, find an abundance of different shops to buy a variety of items from, and clear \"Jails\" (which are pretty much a twisted variation of the old \"Palaces\", you will find out more about them in the game).\n\nAll-in-all, if you are looking to expand your knowledge of the Persona universe, or you just want to beat up a bunch of shadows and bosses, this game is likely for you. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nBelow are my own opinions about the game after clearing through the game and having 100+ hours of experience. Currently on my way to 100%-ing the game's achievements. Whether you agree or disagree to my opinion(s) is all entirely up to you. I have a bias towards the Persona series, but I will try my best to be truthfully honest about this game.\n\n[h2] NEGATIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nWhile this game is overall really good, I can't say this game goes without having a few issues that comes with it straight out of the box. I'll get the negatives out of the way first.\n\n[list]\n[*] My biggest complaint are the random, constant game crashes as well as the infinite loading screens. No matter what you try to do, it seems you can't do anything to fix them. Playing full-screen or windowed-borderless mode causes them more frequently, so I usually play on windowed-mode. You can also try lowering the graphics, but I doubt that'd help. My only tip is to SAVE OFTEN- YOU WILL CRASH. Until they send out a patch to fix these crashes, save often because there is no autosave. I've lost a few hours of progress due to this, the same goes to my friend who's had more crashing issues than me.\n\n[*] Keyboard controls and assisted-aiming feels really clunky. I've played on both keyboard and gamepad, the controls still feel somewhat clunky but once you adjust it should feel fine. The target assistance in the game feels really off, Sometimes I want to ambush a certain enemy, but it ambushes an entirely different enemy. Or even when I want to lock onto a rail to ride on it, I end up doing something completely different.\n\n[*] The anti-aliasing option seems... odd? Not sure how to describe it, but I just left it as it is. Some people might have a problem with it depending on your graphics card.\n\n[*] The DLCs aren't really worth buying separately. You can easily grind the content you get from the DLC. Either buy the Deluxe edition and don't look back, or buy the regular game and play it as it is. Trust me, you'll be fine either way.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] POSITIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nFinally, the positives about the game. There really is a large amount of positives I want to point out from the game, but I'll try to tl;dr it.\n\n[list]\n[*] The storyline is how you expect it to be from a Persona game. You'll be going along for a roller-coaster ride of plot twists, fun and sad moments. You'll easily get attached to some new characters as well. While the gameplay experience isn't as long or sophisticated as the original Persona 5 game, you will still get a nice feeling of satisfaction after clearing the story.\n\n[*] As I mentioned earlier, Atlus feeds us yet another game full of art-beloved UI transitions and new musical compositions. If you love Persona for what it is, you'll love this game. Expect to be jamming to Persona music for a while.\n\n[*] While the battle system has changed into a hack-and-slash style from the original turn-based system, I can say for certain that this is a completely new breath of fresh air. Even by saying it's just a hack-and-slash is not fair to this game, there's much more to it that you'll explore. I actually prefer this over the original combat system. It's just full of constant action and doesn't feel boring at all.\n\n[*] END GAME CONTENT- MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: While there is no clear end-game story, additional content comes in the form of New Game+; essentially you can start a new game with all of your stats carrying over to the new game. You can also opt in to try out Merciless mode, the hardest difficulty of Strikers there is. Once you start Merciless mode, you can't back out. There is also some content you can only unlock in New Game+, so you'll have to play through the game at least twice to unlock all the achievements if you're looking to do that. It feels really nice beating bosses at maximum difficulty.\n\n[*] Each Jail is unique- unlike Palaces from previous games. Every jail you visit will feel fresh, as they're designed to be a new experience from other jails. Each one will have its own atmosphere and aesthetic. Play the game for yourself to find out how different Jails are from Palaces.\n\n[*] You are able to switch between the Phantom Thieves and play as Makoto, Haru, Ann- hell even Morgana. Each thief has their own playstyle. Mix and match your party and find out which strategy works for you! (note: you can't play as Futaba, she's a support character for obvious reasons yet again)\n\n[*] Flashy all-out attacks and showtimes are still present. You will feel like a bad-ass performing these while Last Surprise plays in the background.\n\n[*] PERSONA ON PC!?!?!?!?!? One step closer to Persona becoming the norm for PC gaming.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2] GAME RATINGS [/h2]\n\nControls: 6 / 10 - 7 / 10 if you're on controller\nGameplay: 8.5 / 10\nStoryline: 10 / 10\nMusic: 11 / 10\nWaifus: too powerful to rate\n\nbought the game 3 times for pc + switch, as well for a friend. worth.\n\n[h2] CONCLUSION [/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[i]tl;dr[/i] [b] game good, but please add royal to steam, I have too much free time.[/b]\n\nThat concludes my review of Persona 5: Strikers. Good luck out there, fellow thieves-\n\n\n\n",

However, I cannot recommend it to new players due to the fact it is a continuation of Persona 5's story. If you want this game, I highly recommend you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first before playing this game, although this game is much shorter due to the different gameplay style.\n\nOverall, I recommend this nice game, but perhaps it should add a bit more content in the future.",

        "content": "After eight hours of play I experienced my first crash. This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story. I'll give my final thoughts when I finish.",

I like the way they blended Persona gameplay elements with Dynasty Warriors gameplay, it works really well so you can't just spam attack or just personas. They also encourage you to take your time and try out every party member and not use just Joker as there is no deadlines either.\n\nI 100%ed the game and it took me about 44 hours to do so and I didn't rush through the game either so I'd say that's a good amount if you wanted more Persona 5 content.\n\n",

Given P5 didn't come out on PC however, I'd suggest either playing that first, watching the anime, etc because while the game does try to catch people up a little, most of the story just isn't worth it without that prior experience.\n\nCombat is solid, if at times a little frustrating, but Omega Force adapted their musou styles well here so it doesn't just feel like a licensed skin. Expect shorter fights with enemies that are typically doing more offensive moves.",

        "content": "This game is a must buy for people who have played the original or the Royal version of Persona 5 (or at least in cases have watched a playthrough). The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.",

        "content": "Toughest prison to break out is in your mind\nNow, when I finished it on hard and started my merciless run I can write this rewiew\nMy Exp in Persona games consists of P4G, P5 and P5R\nSo, lets go to the diff, pros and contras\n\nFirst and the most is new combat system. It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends",

All we need now is for Atlus to release Persona 5/Royal on Steam for us PC players to enjoy even more!",

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^",

        "content": "I don't believe in unbiased reviews, but I do believe in going into a game unbiased before playing. I can't say I did that with Persona 5 Strikers because I was so dang excited to play this game.\n\nUpon finishing, I'm happy. Some people say this is a good template for future games, but they're wrong. This is a definitive and refined version of a Persona 5 sequel, but it lacks the emotional depth and sense of time that makes the mainline games so compelling and amazing.\n\nBut what Strikes does well is get the gang who you've already enjoyed a 70-110 hour game with, and take you on another adventure with them. This is a game for those of you who maxed the Confidants in Persona 5, spent a year in Tokyo stealing hearts, and decided you want just a little bit more.\n\nI enjoyed the road trip aspect, as it feels like a more grown up theme than a growing up theme - one of my rites of passage into adulthood was travelling with friends, and Strikers captures that perfectly. This is a game that has grown up with people who played Persona 5 a few years back.\n\nWith that in mind, the writing is solid. Sometimes the characters feel like archetypes, but that's par for the course of a Persona sequel. I see it as more akin to the characters being more comfortable in their own skins, openly being parodies of themselves in a lighthearted fashion. It's also not as on the nose as, say, Persona Q was in this regard, so that's a good thing. I went along with it, at least.\n\nMy biggest reservation was that Omega Force were developing it. I hate Musou games, and I won't lie, when this was first announced I felt a pit in my stomach - I asked myself if this would this be a Persona game I skipped. Thankfully, it's more RPG than Musou to its benefit. I still prefer the turn-based combat, and I miss the Confidants/S.Links, but the action RPG combat complements the more streamlined Persona experience in general, giving the game a sense of pace that isn't needed in a mainline release. I'm amazed that they pulled it off, but they did.\n\nAbout the only flaws, for me at least, with Strikers are the bugs. When it works, the game runs like a dream, but there are some visual glitches in All Out Attacks that are jarring, and the amount of times the game crashed or froze was, frankly, unacceptable. I'm hoping Atlus/Omega Force go in and fix these issues, but I can't help but feel it's tainted my experience. My best advice to deal with them is save often and hope the game doesn't crash during a long story segment.\n\nBugs aside, this is a solid game. It's not a groundbreaking title, but it is a solidly made game that sets out to do a thing and does it. If you've played Persona 5 and wanted one more adventure with the Phantom Thieves, this is \u00a355 well spent.",

This game further develops the characters from P5 and brings new ones to the table, which are all pretty well written.\nSo far, the story is pretty decent, nothing stellar, though it's hard for me to judge, not having finished the game yet.\n\nGameplay is a solid mix between Persona 5 elements (Elemental weaknesses, baton pass, all out attacks, and of course personas) and what you'd find in the warriors series of games (basically inane amount of enemies and unique character combos). Some people seem to think this game is a musou. I'd argue that while it borrows a lot from the genre, it is, in fact, mostly just an Action RPG, which is not a bad thing in the end. However, due to the nature of the game, this can easily feel repetitive after a while.\nDifficulty is a bit confusing though. Normal encounters often ends in seconds while bosses can be extremely frustrating at times.\n\nGraphically the game is decent, UIs are stylish as you'd expect from a Persona game, but... the anti-aliasing they use (FXAA) is terrible, and affects the UI, this is pretty bad. I really recommend to disable the game's AA and make use of [url=https://reshade.me/]reshade[/url]'s SMAA instead or, if your PC can handle it, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405510545]supersampling[/url] to make things look good.\n\nThe soundtrack is full of bangers, as you'd also expect from a Persona game. Some of the tracks here are the best Persona 5 and its spin-offs can offer. Play this with good headphones.\n\nNow... Not all is good. Be warned that the game is locked at 60/30 FPS and sometimes randomly crashes when loading cutscenes. Save often.\n\nIf you can handle its little flaws and quirks, then this game is a pretty solid entry in the Persona franchise. And a pretty good game overall.\n\n[h2]If you don't have the time, here's the tl;dr...[/h2]\n* Game is a sequel to Persona 5 and will be much more enjoyable if you played it before.\n* Game is not a musou. It's an Action RPG where encouters are made of massive amount of enemies. The battle system itself is a mix of mechanics you'd find in Persona and Musou games.\n\n+ Story is pretty good and the new characters are great.\n+ Battles are pretty fun.\n+ The soundtrack might contain some of the best tracks in the series.\n\n- The difficulty curve is pretty weird. Normal encounters are easy, bosses are frustrating.\n- Graphically \"decent\". The Anti-Aliasing is terrible.\n- Framerate lock. (60/30 FPS)\n- Game sometimes crashes.\n\n[h3]Obligatory \"Please bring Persona 5 Royal to PC pls\".[/h3]",

        "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "Strikers serves as a good sequel to Persona 5. It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.",

        "content": "I was a bit worried at first that this game wouldn't live up to Persona 5, and well, I shouldn't have been. This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan. (Or just like Mass Destruction)",

        "content": "First of all. [h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well. A definite must have for those who enjoy both persona and musou combat type of games.",

If you have played it though, this game is a very intriguing new story that takes place afterwards. It's awesome to have the gang back together for another adventure!",

        "content": "*IMPORTANT* \nThis game crashes ALOT, at the worst time possible. I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse. It's up to you to make your own opinion on it.",

I was really happy to see this game out as i am a huge persona fan and have played person 4 golden and persona 5 royal and i was really sad to have beat the game and of the ending being a sorrow goodbye. This game is a lot like persona 5 but with the formatting of Fire emblem warriors or what others have said dynasty warriors. You can use your persona in this game but there is more hand combat rather then only using your persona or automated bullets like in persona 4 and 5. i love that you can also be the other characters and walk around aka yuskue and ana and etc, that is one of my favorite things as i am a huge fan of yusuke and i love being able to explore the jails as him and use him more!  I do really enjoy this game and got it the day it released but i will say there is a ton of glitches going on as the game tends to crash in times where you are unable to save and have to restart again. That can be a real pain in the butt especially when your grinding or in the middle of a movie scene. But i overall really enjoy this game and would recommend it to any persona fan and CAN NOT WAIT FOR PERSONA 6 TO COME OUT! SOLID 9/10.",

        "content": "Spoiler Free!\n\n-Story: This is basically Persona 5-2. The story is a direct continuation of P5, and so if you haven't played the first one, you'll definitely be lost in this game. The writing quality is on par with if not better than the original. \n-Characters: There are some points where the original Phantom Thieves feel exaggerated, but for the most part they're very strong. Not nearly as flanderized as previous Persona spin offs. The new cast members are excellent additions. It's impressive that even with 10-ish characters, no one feels left out of the story. Also Haru got her screen time.\n-Gameplay: The combat is simple enough to get into, but has enough elements to make fights feel like more than just button mashing. Weaknesses, One Mores, Environment attacks, etc. all help keep you thinking about how to attack.\n\nAside from a few nitpicks here and there, I would say this game is excellent. Very fun combat and a great sequel story. The main limiting factor is if you haven't played P5. If you haven't played it, I wouldn't recommend this game. The combat is fun, but it's not enough to sell the game if you're not also interested in the story. Play P5 first so you'll understand these characters and what they're talking about when they mention past events.\n",

        "content": "Strikers is a very welcome surprise. While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.",

Do not play this unless you have played Persona 5.\nIf you have played Persona 5, I don't think you need me to tell you why I'm recommending a direct story sequel to it.\n\nSlight performance issues with the PC port. The framerate is capped at 60, and game logic is tied to the framerate. There's two modes: 30fps mode and 60fps mode. On 60fps mode with my GTX1060, I can't even maintain 10fps on medium at times, whereas on 30fps mode, I'm comfortably locked at 30fps even on high graphics. It's very bizzare. The default keybinds are not super logical but the kb+m controls are otherwise fine. Generally an okay port overall; definitely playable, if not entirely ideal.",

It was quite hard for me to get introduced to the new mechanics such as abilities, fast forward, ect.\n\nIt's worth mentioning how Atlus actually made a follow up to the P5 story and brings an amazing comeback to the Phantom thieves.

The combat is much less Dynasty Warriors than anticipated on my part, it's deep and kinda challenging, especially at bosses. It's very story driven, so if long cutscenes bore you, you might aswell skip that game because this game does contain a lot of story only times with no gameplay at all.",

The music slaps, scenery and art style is amazing, and the characters themselves are very funny and interesting.  Yusuke is so extra that I smile every time he talks.  \n\nGameplay wise, the combat is so much fun.  I much prefer this over the fighting style of P4 (and I suppose P5 as well).  I love zooming around jails and jumping on things.  I also like the bonding system that P5S offers, once again, I prefer this over the individual character bonding that was in P4.  \n\nShould you play P5S before playing P5? In my opinion: sure, why not?  You may spoil yourself and not pick up on every reference or joke, but the combat and story is awesome and I highly recommend it.",

        "content": "Well, time to give a review on the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n[b]SPOILER FREE[/b]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nPersona 5 Striker\u2019s story is probably the most disappointing part of the game. Keep in mind that I did not care for the og Persona 5\u2019s story so I had some doubts about this story going in. I thought the story would be bad due to the same reasons I disliked P5\u2019s story, but the things that irked me in this game are different than what irked me in P5. The story is good. It plays with some ideas and themes that work very well. It has emotional moments that work well and the story sets out to do what it wants to do. That is be a summer road trip story around Japan with the Phantom Thieves facing a new threat. My problem is that the story plays it SUPER safe. [b]Spoiler:[/b] [spoiler]It\u2019s almost a repeat of og P5\u2019s story, which is a shame.[/spoiler] It\u2019s also very predictable. If you think to yourself \u201cthis person(s) probably the bad guy,\u201d you\u2019re most likely right. It\u2019s very easy to tell where the story is going. Again, it\u2019s not bad. I still very much enjoyed this story over og P5\u2019s. It just has so much missed potential that completely bums me out. \n\nWhatever the case, you NEED to play og P5 before this as the game 100% assumes you know that game through and through already. Hopefully, they release og P5 or P5R so pc players can play that before this.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nNow, THIS I can get behind. Like many, I had some fears going into this game as I felt this game would be yet another mindless Musou game where you spam attacks and win. And while spamming attacks can get you far pretty early on, it won\u2019t carry you much farther. P5 was half a JRPG and half a social sim. This game is 100% an action RPG. Some will be disappointed by the lack of social sim stuff, but I think the non inclusion of it allows for better pacing in the gameplay, and including it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the type of story and gameplay Strikers is going for. The new BOND system is a simple yet effective alternative to it I believe. The fighting itself lends itself so well to the warriors\u2019 style of combat. Persona elements like weaknesses, technicals, personas, etc mix so well with it. Each character is a joy to control and each one is just different from one other. Each one of them has their own gameplay purpose. The combat is engaging, and constantly asks you to stay on your toes and use the most of your arsenal since not doing so will result in you dying FAST. Try spamming the attack button on bosses or bigger enemies and see how fast you can die. Using weaknesses and technicals as well as knowing what combos to use is key in beating anything in this game.\n\nThe Jails (which are similar to palaces to P5) were all fun to explore and it was joy to see just how creative they could get. Seriously, most of them were fun going through, obtaining loot, doing requests (which are fun and rewarding except the ones where you have to go to an area without getting caught fuck those), and beating shadows was a blast. Some of the beginning Jails are a bit too close in structure for my liking, but the game quickly switches it up, so it\u2019s not a big deal. I do, however, feel that the game got a bit too easy at the end due to just how overpowered spamming weakness and technicals can be at times. I was playing on hard and while it was certainly ballbustingly hard early on due to SP drain, the game got a bit too easy at the end for my liking.  \n\nOther complaints include the lack of gun upgrades. I get the omission of social sim stuff among some other things, but no gun upgrades or customization? Why? That makes no sense since I actually like using guns in this game. Such a weird omission. Furthermore, persona fusing is super basic for seemingly no reason. I don\u2019t understand why they simplified Persona\u2019s robust persona fusing to such a simple state. However, other than the complaints I mentioned, I found the combat overall to be exceptional and constantly engaging. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nThe writing in Strikers is incredible. This game got many laughs out of me and made me feel a lot. However, the writing for the more emotional moments can get a bit too on the nose for my liking, a common problem for Persona, unfortunately. The villain(s) were all fantastic in how they went about their way of doing things instead of the one-dimensional cartoonishly evil villains in P5. They\u2019re all fantastic. However, some backstory for some of the villain(s) gets thrown in your face like 20 seconds before fighting them which felt cheap, even if it was effective. The main characters (Ryuji, Ann, Haru, Futaba, etc) all remain the great characters they are, but they see little growth in the main story. I mean it\u2019s there, but not enough in my opinion.\n\nNow to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, I love the inclusion of Zenkichi and Sophia. Sophia is an adorable muffin that sees an unbelievable amount of growth in the story. It\u2019s to the point where I consider Sophia to be one of my favorites in all of the Persona series. Zenkichi was amazing as well with a lovable personality and real growth, although not to the extent of Sophia. But they both remain absolutely incredible inclusions to the series.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nIt\u2019s Persona. What do you think? Of course, it\u2019s incredible. The remixes of P5 music as well as the original music in Strikers are all fantastic. [i]Counter Strike[/i] and [i]Daredevil[/i] being personal favs.\n\nHowever, the audio mixing could use some work. The characters become REALLY difficult to hear during boss fights especially with the music is blaring. This can be remedied by messing with the audio levels in the in-game settings, but I hate that this is even an issue.\n\n[b]PC PORT[/b]\n\nWhat a disappointment. Firstly, the positives. The game runs at a stable 60fps all the time. I only ever saw frame drops during cutscenes and the velvet room of all places. Other than that, the performance is solid.\n\nNow for the negatives. This game LOVES to crash. It mainly ever crashed for me during fast travel or loading screens. During my 60 hour journey, I crashed a total of 7 times. [b]7!!![/b] Sometimes I would lose upwards of an hour of progress. Do you know how much it sucks to bust your balls on a difficult boss only for the game to crash afterward without saving? Next, the game options are poor. The game is capped at 60fps. I don\u2019t know if this is an engine issue or if the devs were too lazy to uncap it or what. Furthermore, the game still looks poor. Not the style, mind you (P5 style is still present here in all its glory), but the game doesn\u2019t look enhanced at all for PC. Textures can be muddy and the UI quality REAKS. WHY IS IT SO PIXILATED?! Overall, a pretty disappointing port. Also, RIP mods.\n\nEDIT 03/17/2021: New update has been pushed today that [i]seems[/i] to have fixed or at least remedied the constant crashing. So that's cool.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts[/b]\n\nOverall, my expectations were blown away by this game. I was expecting a mindless button masher that would give me some kicks based purely on seeing my favorite characters get back together. It is so much more than that. It\u2019s got its issues, sure. It\u2019s not perfect and some things really drag the game down. However, it does so much right at the same time. This isn\u2019t just a spinoff, it\u2019s the true Persona 5 sequel.",

        "content": "The closest thing we'll get from Persona 5 on PC until Atlus ports the thing itself or (preferably) the Royal remake.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It is basically Persona 5-2, but with a complete change in gameplay. If you enjoyed the original game, this title is a must. I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.",

Persona 3 and 5 are some of my favorite games ever and it kind of baffles my mind how much worse the story and characters are when compared to how they were in original P5 and Royal. The game is fun sometimes, the dialogue is good sometimes, the music is good sometimes. Always just sometimes good. Honestly I remember about 3 or 4 songs from the soundtrack which is baffling to me because if you played the entire 181 tracks from original Persona 5 I could probably name 85%-90% of them. The gameplay is fun... until you hit a certain point and it just gets so insanely stale. You never have to care about fusing cool personas because it's a cakewalk with a single good boss. The characters are shadows of their original personalities. Honestly the only thing this game has over original persona 5 is some better humor. I really don't know why I'm giving this a positive review lol I felt so incredibly numb.",

        "content": "As someone who never really played Musou games, P5S was originally an odd concept but i was willing to give it a shot on account of it being more Persona 5 and a good excuse to spend time with the Phantom Thieves. \n\nI expected it to be a Musou game with a P5 skin but what we have here is a Persona game with Musou mechanics. The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps. No frame loss but i will say that at this time, the game does not support ultra-wide so i get black bars on the side do restrict it to 2560x1440. Not aware of any workaround for that yet.",

        "content": "I just beat this game and did all the side quests, if you love persona 5 at all, you should too. I very rarely do serious steam reviews, and i understand it takes a lot for this game to even appeal to you, but if you have played Persona 5 it is a phenomenal sequel in every way, extremely well thought out and thrilling combat, awesome characters and story, and of course a banging soundtrack to boot. It has a couple flaws such as many decisions not having much consequence, some early game resource management problems, and the ending being slightly underwhelming, but overall still amazing. I absolutely love Persona 5 Strikers",

        "content": "Just rolled credits, and man this was pretty great.\n\nI've never enjoyed a Dynasty Warriors type game, and also felt weird that they were making a canonical sequel to the original. But honestly, this game really really impressed me. It felt like Persona 5 in pretty much every aspect. It didn't feel like a budget title, they really went all out. From what I understand, this is probably the best game Omega Force has put out.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ More time with the main cast\n+ The whole english dub crew being back is great.\n+ The main plot was pretty good. A bit more predictable than P5/R, but still really nice and better than I expected.\n+ The two new characters are great, [Spoiler]Gramps[/spoiler] in particular. \n+ Surprisingly fleshed out city locations that give some of those P5 vibes\n+ Ran really well on my 8700k/2060. 1440p @ 60fps, super sampled quite a bit. After that, it loses that jagged look of the consoles and looks just like the original.\n\nNit-picks (These are all really minor):\n- Persona 5 Royal is non-canon in this sequel, which stinks.\n- It doesn't acknowledge your relationship from the original. (Which I completely understand would be a lot to ask, it just throws my head-canon off a bit when Makoto seems to forget we were dating.)\n- There is one particular achievement to max out all of the BOND skills... which is insanely grindy, and dissuades me from 100%'ing the game. All the other achievements are really fair, but this one is just horrible. \n- You get overpowered rather quickly after the first jail, I never really had to decide which character to spend money on. I could simply just buy everyone the best weapon and armor the moment they became available. \n- You can tell the english dub had to record from their closets at home, so the audio levels are a bit off sometimes. \n\nA couple of spoiler-free tips:\n- Upgrade the Bondmaker skill as soon as it is available.\n- Unlock all the party members Master Arts ASAP. They are fun to use, and don't take much effort to unlock.\n- Make sure you google how to get your game looking nice. The default settings really don't look that good. You don't have to mod, you just need to make a couple changes.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers was exactly what I wanted in an action Persona game. It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events. You can enter and exit dungeons all you want, and the day will still stay the same.",

I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.",

The Default controls are AWFUL. they're really bad, so I recommend using a controller, or changing them. I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues. I just hope some of this stuff gets patched out, or fixed in some way shape or form, and I want to look forward to some nice ports in the future!",

The review is mostly semantic - Persona stans have already bought it, and if you aren't part of the crew yet this might be a weird place to jump in. For what it's worth, the game is respectful of spoilers to the previous game, and was made before Royal so you're safe there, but you probably want to wait for P5R to get ported to PC before diving in. \n\nAnd Atlus, I'm ready to throw money at a Sophia figure whenever you're ready to make one. I'll mail you a blank check, write down what you think is fair.",

        "content": "I like Warrior games and I like Persona so I'm sure this game is cool and all but this port is just so awful. \n\nSometimes the game just wont boot unless I restart my PC, then once it does play, it can randomly crash to which I will have to restart my PC again to get the game to boot, and the game has terrible aliasing even with AA on, but with AA on all the UI gets super distorted on the edges, including text. I'm running this game off of an NVME SSD that loads other Triple A games in seconds, but this game legitimately takes minutes to load everytime I see a loading screen. \n\nThis game is also way more difficult to run that it should be. At 2560x1440 on a GTX1080 with a Ryzen 9 3900x, I can not play this game at a locked 60fps even at low settings. For comparison, I am able to play Monster Hunter World at mid-high settings at a locked 60fps at 3440x1440. There's also no uncapped framerate option, no ultrawide support, the rendering resolution scale doesn't do anything for me, there are barely any graphical setting tweaks and overall this port is a mess. But that's just a Koei Techmo game for you. I hope ATLUS will do better going forward because Persona 4 Golden was pretty well done, but that was also a PS Vita remake of a PS2 port.",

        "content": "Game initially was a good homage to Persona 5 but soon became apparent it was not going to follow well in its footsteps. The game starts of strong with a strong opening and good display of the mechanics and gameplay but as you progress through the game you realise it is just a dynasty game. \n\nUnfortunately the game lacks substance. Its all combat oriented but even that is shoddy at best. The story within this game is extremely lack-lustre compared to its predecessors. The amount of actual story in this game is questionable at best. With the removal of confidants and making dialogue scenes more and more scarce there is no actual character development.\n\nThe game is also bugged. Even on a good rig the game still runs slowly and at one point the \ngame would soft lock you from continuing. To remedy this I had to try multiple methods that were convoluted just to progress. The gameplay at times can also feel clunky as its lock on camera and obstacles make it so that you character doesn't move freely or how you want.\n\nOverall the game isn't worth the price tag. Get it on sale. Or just play Royal. It has the content of a side story not a sequel so it is far overpriced. Overall if the bugs were fixed the story is just compelling enough for a P5 fan to want to play but it is not worthy of being a sequel as it lacks the substance Persona 5 had.",

        "content": "The sequel to persona 5 (Royal), As a PC only player I never got to play royal but I have played Persona 3, 4 and 5. The games are a gift. They are spectacularly flashy, great characters and great turn-based combat. This one is different. It is a Warriors/Musou game. This entail huge battles and being overloaded by enemies. I love the combat and I strongly recommend this games to fans of the series or fans of action games.\n\nA caveat to this is that, it's a sequel. The game is 100% enjoyable if its you're first persona game or you've only played persona 4 Golden. It does have major plot spoilers to Persona 5.\n\nA problem that the game suffers from is it is locked at 60FPS. This game would benefit hugely from unlocked frames.\n\nAll in all its a stellar sequel to persona 5 and a great standalone action experience. If you've played persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal it is a must buy.",

        "content": "More Persona 5 is what I need in my life. And Atlus was happy to oblige. And that makes me happy.\n\nThis is probably a horrible place to start of with Persona. Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable. Real shame. But I'm not gonna complain, since things turned out pretty good.",

        "content": "Important note that this is SEQUEL to Persona 5 and should not be your jumping on point for the series. You should play and beat either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this in order to not spoil yourself on characters and events, the game assumes you have beaten that game. \n\nTo sum it up briefly, Strikers takes all the trappings from P5 and mixes in a battle system that feels like an Action-RPG in a musou's trench coat, in which you need to pay attention to weaknesses and strengths of both your team and your enemy. The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n",

Shadows pop up in mob forms, and often mini bosses (strong shadows with health bars up top) come out to play, but hack n slashing won't get you far. You must use strategy to beat most enemies. Run n Gun with joker only got me to the 2nd jail (palace in this game). \n\nOverall it's fun, and aside from getting the deluxe edition to only allow me access to the bonus content on separate disk/download and can't install to my computer.\n\n",

Haven't had any crashes and the story is nice so far, especially if you want some more phantom thieves action. Overall, it's worth it.\n\nJust finished it and it was definitely on par with persona 5's story. Must get if you played the 5th. I highly recommend playing the 5th before this one though. Hopefully persona 5 royal comes to pc soon so everyone on pc can enjoy it because it is a masterpiece.",

        "content": "If you're already a fan of Persona 5 and you're itching for more, this title is worth your time.\n\nThis title oozes with the same style and poise that Persona 5 has. The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat. Especially since the majority of players of this game are likely Persona vets.",

What I love about Persona was the stories and life-sim aspects, and to a lesser extent the style the series just oozes at all times. Which, unfortunately, Persona 5 Strikers does lack in - there is no real life-sim aspect, and it still has style to it though perhaps not as much as the game it was based off of, but the story is still there and in full force - very enjoyable\n\nI do think that Strikers is quite difficult compared to its mainline entry, but that comes with the territory of an action-based vs. turn-based game. Since I'm not interested, I played on easy, and I still find that Strikers is too difficult for my liking. I know, I know, get good, but again - not my cup of tea, I'm here for the story.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is an intermittent crashing. My first 8 hours or so were fine, but the next few have seen a number of frustrating crashes... I really don't want to have to play parts over and over again, but I find myself needing to. \n\nOverall though, want more Persona? Here you go. Enjoy.",

        "content": "Please stop begging for a persona 5 port and just review the damn game.\n\nI had left a positive review for this game but it's become apparent the overwhelmingly positive reviews are pretty undeserved. Enjoyed the game a whole lot as a returning persona fan but a loading bug had prevented me from being able to finish the game. There is no workaround as of right now but the fact alone is pretty unacceptable. Please hop off the bandwagon and actually use your reviews to get this game in an acceptable state. Lesser problems include the fact that the antialiasing is terrible if you're playing on anything short of 1440p and the loading screens were already way too long for what they actually loaded into. Quite sad, hope it gets fixed soon so I can recommend this game again. (FYI if you haven't played persona 5, even when the ridiculous technical issues get solved, don't buy this. Play p5 first, ps4s aren't that expensive if you want to join this bandwagon so badly.)",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game. If you're into that, then you'll like this game. THOUGH, nothing on this page will tell you that. BUT as soon as I saw the Koie Tecmo logo followed by Omega Force, I got a sneaking suspicion this was a Dynasty Warriors game. THOUGH, as someone who's only played a handful of these and 3 of their off shoots (including this one), I kind of like this one the best. Yeah, you can button mash, but this and Hyrule Warriors was better at forcing other actions. I've played Persona 5 for a few seconds, but got SUPER bored with how story heavy it is, and how awful the story is, this has a bit too much for me. It's a neat and faithful melding of Persona and the DW formula. Visually this is the best Dynasty Warriors has ever looked. Clear that Sega/Atlus seem to be very protective of this property and were very hands on with it. \n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona then this will definitely scratch that itch. I'll stick around for the battles, and just blow through the story, even though I know from previous attempts of getting into this series (P4 Golden) it means I'll probably get a bad ending, oh well. I'll look up an FAQ if the alternative endings are better or if it prolongs the GAME play. I like it. 3.5 out of 5 for me.",

Having to meet Phantom Thieves again was fun[spoiler] Not meeting Akechi though was a bummer [/spoiler]. And there is a lot of fan service [spoiler] The dialogue when Joker acted as a decoy in the first jail was pretty funny ngl(when Ryuji said is this a deja vu and other dialogue that came before it) [/spoiler] I haven't completed the game yet(only finished the first dungeon) but i would give it a 8/10.

If you go straight into Strikers, you won't understand some parts of the story. Fun beat em up game and great story, but some of the requests are pretty annoying to do. The crashes and FPS drops are somewhat annoying as well, but as long as you download the beta fix from Steam, you will be fine. Overall, I highly recommend this game :D 10/10",

The gameplay is a ton of fun with a lot of personas to mess around with. Music is fantastic as always expected with smt and persona games. Not much could be changed to make this game play better, but on the technical side the game does tend to crash a lot past the first jail, crashing like every 5 loading screens, but that might just be something with my computer. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag, and has a decent amount of replayability, with a ng+ and an extra difficulty.",

If you have been wanting more Persona 5 writing, I would most certainly come to Persona 5 Strikers. While the turn based combat has left the scene, real time hack and slash combat fuses with the beloved Megaten mechanics to create a truly electrifying party. \n\nCoupled with amazing remixes of past P5 songs and the same characters you know and love, Strikers is a game that is hard *not* to recommend. The writing is some of the best ever put in a Megaten game, and there are so many improvements compared to Persona 5, such as UI refreshes, lighting overhauls, superior texture work, and many other additions.\n\nPersona fans and Musou fans will feel very much at home here. I am loving this game, and glad it has come to me in such a low time for the entire world. It is a ray of sunshine in a ever so gloomy and cloudy year.",

In around 18 hours of gameplay it happened 3 times. I lost around 2-3 hours re-doing stuff I already did because my game crashed. It really disrupts the flow of an otherwise really cool story and gameplay. \nThere is no autosave, which was understandable in the original game with its playstyle, but here (in a game where you can get in and out of the jails with no repercussions whatsoever on time management AND get refills for hp and sp for the entire party) is just dumb. \nThe crashes are a big problem that needs to be solved, but it would have been a tad bit better with an autosave function. Again, the game is good, but this is a major problem that needs to be a priority for the development team in a future patch (that needs to come ASAP).",

        "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Persona 5 fan, having played the base game several times and Royal twice. I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100",

        "content": "I absolutely reccommend this game.  It's insane how much this feels like the original Persona 5.  With a few exceptions, the entire game feels exactly like the first game did; menus, dungeons, boss designs...  It's incredible.  I was expecting a musou game more in-line with the others I've played; Hyrule and Fire Emblem Warriors.  Gone are the big battlefields of those games, replaced with small, tighter skirmishes that fit this sort of game better.\n\nThis game would be nearly perfect in my eyes, except for one thing: Denuvo.  Denuvo made my game crash more than a handful of times.  It was a serious drag each time I had to reload and go back sometimes to upwards of an hour.  Sega needs to remove it from the Steam version ASAP.  I had a friend who gave me a launcher without Denuvo, and in those last few hours of gameplay, not only did the game run better and load faster, but it didn't crash once.  \n\nThat aside, if you liked Persona 5, absolutely give this game a shot.  It was the sequel I didn't know I could have.",

The game is a lot more Persona-like than I thought, since it is a \"Warriors\"-type game, which is a nice surprise.\n\nAt the first real free exploration of the first Palace I have only a few complaints.\n\n1) The game crashed on me after about an hours worth of exploration and dialogue.\n2) The game for some reason takes AGES to load when you boot it up. (I kid you not it takes like 2 whole minutes of just loading after you launch it. Weird.)\n\nEDIT; \n\nThe current beta branch (which I am assuming the full patch will launch some time in the coming weeks) has fixed the crashing/hang ups for people. PLUS, if you're like me and were suffering from long loading times either on launch or just in general (even on an SSD) if you set the game to always run as Administrator it helps a lot, not sure why but hey it was worth mentioning if it helps anyone. :)",

        "content": "With most of the negative reviews focusing entirely on the technical issues with the game, I figure I'll complain about the game itself just to shake things up a bit. There will be unmarked spoilers.\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Consider this more of a \"meh\" review. If you just wanna see the gang get back together for a demon-slaying road-trip, are willing to be even more fragile than the Demi-Fiend at the start of Nocturne, and don't mind bosses with insane HP values, it's stylish like Persona 5 always has been and may be worth picking up. YMMV with the story. Also, Futaba makes cute noises when you enter the system menu. This is very important.\n\n[b] Gameplay:[/b] Having tried Normal and Hard difficulty settings, it feels all over the place so far. Both incoming and outgoing damage fluctuates on a per-fight basis between being crushed by a black hole (dying/killing in 2-3 hits) or being slapped by a wet noodle, even when exploiting weaknesses. Taking advantage of persona resistances seems to work, but nothing will save your braindead AI companions from standing in pools of whatever element they're weak to and dying/wasting SP on healing. \n\nIt sucks because the most effective way to take down a boss, assuming you don't want to waste twenty minutes whittling it down while it endlessly spawns additional demons, is to stand still, open the command menu so time freezes, switch to a Persona that can exploit its weaknesses, and spam attacks, maybe switching to another character when you run out of SP. \n\nThis is almost necessary because bosses have an obscene amount of HP, and spamming attacks from the menu deals damage far faster than trying to use the free, reduced-strength spells from combos. It also has the side effect of practically guaranteeing you're not getting hit by anything while trying to pull off said combos, which feels really cheap.\n\n\n[b] Story: [/b] I haven't finished the game yet, but so far the stakes are at an all-time low for the Phantom Thieves. The first target was acceptable since she went out of her way to abuse some innocent people, but the second target in particular had me rolling my eyes; as far as I can tell, his only \"crime\" was not admitting that his novels were hot garbage that only sold well because his editors manipulated him and hyped up his status as the grandson of a famous writer. There was a claim about him plagiarizing, but he wouldn't be the first popular author to do just that and get away with it.\n\nForcing that kid to go on live television and \"confess\" to the heinous crime of being manipulated into writing bad novels had me in stitches. At best, it felt like petty revenge for something that happens all the time IRL in all kinds of media. At worst, it could have no lasting effect; realistically all the company would need to do is throw a few employees under the bus along with the kid in some kind of apology letter, wait a few months, and then the public would forget all about it.\n\nIn short, it's a far cry from changing the hearts of the people from Persona 5. Stopping a teacher from preying on students and driving them to suicide? I'm down, no question. \n\nStopping a famous idol from abusing the people around her? Sure, I guess. \n\nStopping a writer from writing bad novels?\n \n...\n\nWho gives a shit?",

It literally feels like Persona 5 like all the characters you were friends with going on a road trip across Japan. I didn't think the sequel of Persona 5 would be good, but it turned out amazing af. They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick. Even the soundtracks are as amazing as the OG Persona 5. You know the GAME is good when I played it everyday when I got it, or waiting after doing work and playing it. So far my favorite quarantine game to escape from reality",

P5S continues the story of the original Persona 5 game based on where it's left off but has a twist that none of it's predecessors saw coming. It plays in a Musou fashion where you smack and annihilate enemies in real time combat. It borrows the same concept as Persona 5 where you can use your skills in the midst of combat. Being in constant 60 FPS, the game runs smoothly and feels natural to the touch. The story and voice acting is as superb as usual and it doesn't stray far from the original Persona 5 despite being a different type of game. To Atlus, Don't be afraid to release the other Persona games onto Steam. Many people look forward to it for multiple reasons such as not owning the specified console or in this case, introduces a lot of newcomers into the series. Persona 5 Strikers is definitely a game that's going to do very well so as for other future games that's to come.",

The change in combat is pretty fun imo.  \n\nYou get upgrades in the form of using the Bond skills page, an item shop for better weapons, armor, etc and you still get to fuse Personas and make em stronger as well. \n\nThe new character Sophia is adorable AF and Ryuji gets clowned on some more so that's a plus.\n\nOverall it's basically P5 Lite Edition and I'd say that it works out pretty damn well.",

It never quite reaches the levels of P5/P5R but it's more persona and more of the characters you love however, at this very moment in time I would not recommend it due to constant crashes during cut scenes. So far I've encountered about 10 crashes of the game sometimes taking hours me back multiple hours of progress because of long sections of the game not allowing you to save and or me forgetting. If this is fixed then I'll change this review but until then the crashes are so frustrating at this moment in time it's simply not worth it.",

You also start combat like in Persona 5 rather than have all enemies on the map at all times, so neither battles nor zones are as big or open as warriors titles usually are. If that sounds good then go for it since this is probably one of Koei's best games, but if you were expecting a traditional warriors game you might be disappointed.",

The gameplay is very fun and what makes it even better is the fact that they made each and every character's kit and moveset completely unique on top of the mindblowing soundtrack (which is basically a given in any game in the franchise) and design. I am playing on hard difficulty just because I didn't want to blow through the game in a day and it pretty tough for me, as someone who hasn't really played this genre of game at all. But despite that, I've never once gotten irritated at failing multiple times in a fight, rather I think about what I could do differently until I figure out what works and what doesn't and amidst that, memorizing the movesets of the enemies until I eventually complete the encounter, feeling a sense of accomplishment after several failed attempts. That however is only the tip of the iceberg, it takes some of the core things from vanilla P5 and incorporates it quite smoothly into itself, which in turn makes it feel like a true successor to vanilla. For 60$, I honestly believe that this game is worth every cent. 10/10 would cat van again.",

As for the story, from where I'm at, it's amazing. It integrates old characters and obviously includes some new ones.

        "content": "Having finally finished Persona 5 after playing through it for six months, I decided to hop onto Persona 5 Strikers as soon as I finished. I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.",

        "content": "I recommend this game but it is more of a cautionary one.\n\n*Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5. It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)",

I was hoping I would like this hack 'n slash game as I have a tough time enjoying the genre, but this game just isn't for me. The game was also fairly unstable while I played, though I won't say anything more because hopefully the new update fixed it for the persisting / new players.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers The Review\n\nPlayed On: PC (Steam)\nCompleted Date: 3/17/2021\nPlaytime: 72.5 hours\n\nStatus: Completed 100%.  \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not Persona 5 Royal) and follows the same loveable crew on a road trip journey. It uses a new hack and slash action RPG combat inspired in part by Musuo games like Dynasty Warriors but is still ostensibly Persona.\n\nGraphics [80/100]:\nThe graphics of Persona 5 Strikers follows the same style of the main entry using the stylized cel shading graphics. These graphics pop and look great.  They ooze style and feel unique.  Strikers is a bit more colorful compared to the original.  The overall package is fantastic and well thought out.  If you liked the style of Persona 5 or anime in general you will enjoy this as it is more of the same.  \n\nBattle System / Combat / Core Gameplay [92/100]:\nThe battle system in Persona 5 Strikers is a massive departure from the original.  It is no longer a turn based JRPG game but now it is an action based hack and slash that uses the ideas from the Persona world. That said, combat is fantastic and fun. It is both fast paced and strategic as you have to abuse the system, as any good Persona game would have you do, to beat the mini bosses and bosses since they have large health pools. The difference is you have to dodge and move and input commands as you go. When it came down to it I found this all very fun and all of the characters have unique and different play styles that made for a fun and challenging game. The game does abandon most of the outside of combat gameplay from the original game which keeps the game moving steady but you do miss social links for sure.\n\n Audio [75/100]:\nThe voice acting and music is good. Voice acting is top notch and everyone nails it in the English dub. The music is also good but lacks some of the best songs from the original. It still has the feels but with the missing songs it doesn\u2019t quite have the same pizzaz that the original brought. I still enjoyed it.  \n\nControls [71/100]:\nControls are responsive for the most part. There is a slight delay whenever you open a menu that you must wait out prior to doing things but it\u2019s easy to become used to that. All the menus are animated so it\u2019s not bad having to wait a second. Characters can feel a bit loose when running but I got used to it quickly enough.\n\nStory [82/100]:\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers follows after the original game and while this story isn\u2019t quite as good it still brings it. We get extended time with the entire crew as we go on a road trip and this is a great experience and I find that this group fits incredibly well with this format. We begin unraveling the metaverse yet again and from there the story unfolds and the intricacies can be found and present themselves very well.\n\nExtras [60/100]:\nThe side quests (requests) are almost entirely go collect something or go kill something. These can be fun since some of the kill quests are pretty challenging and the rewards are good. There are occasional quests to explore parts of the dungeon without porting or getting spotted and these are different and fun as well.  As a whole though the side quests offer little story or interesting add ons outside of challenge and good rewards. \n\nOverall [87/100]:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a fantastic game that has a combat system that is fun and engaging while being simple and flashy as well. The story is good and interesting and the characters are still as fantastic as ever. If you are a fan of Persona 5 this is a must play. For others as this is a direct sequel I would recommend Persona 5 first then this. If you didn\u2019t like Persona 5 this plays so differently that you may still like it as long as it wasn\u2019t the aesthetics that you didn\u2019t enjoy.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

The combat is so smooth and is super addictive. I sometimes forget I'm actually playing a Warriors/Musou game when playing P5S, I don't know how to explain it but its like playing a real time battle version of Persona 5? Like how FF7 became FF7R.. Anyway this game is great! Highly recommend it even at full price!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.",

The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series",

Truly worthy of being called a Persona 5 sequel. \n\nUnfortunately, that's utterly irrelevant when the PC port is in such a shotty state. The game will randomly freeze up with no pattern or apparent cause--usually it'll recover on its own but even then you'll often have to wait minutes. It didn't happen to me in the first 10 or so hours, but ever since it's been happening with increasing frequency to the point that it's unplayable now. Tragic.\n\nThere are also other minor issues like DS4 rumble not working, analog inputs being snapped to the cardinal directions, a 60 FPS cap, blurry fonts at 4k, and settings that don't work without a restart (with no indication). \n\nSave yourself the hastle and buy the PS4 version (the Switch version does not run well, but that's a review for another day).",

        "content": "This is a great sequel and spin-off of P5, it takes place after the events of P5 and has a completely new combat system. It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

        "content": "When this game was first revealed, I was honestly skeptical if a Persona installment would work with the mechanics of a Musou game. Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

Story is not as good as the original persona 5 or persona 5 royal, but it absolutely has it's moments. Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one. Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

        "content": "This might one day be a fantastic game, but right now I've gotta say hold off on buying it until they fix all the bugs. I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.",

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game. I mean. Top rating.",

He and the rest of his Friends decided to go camping after they've got reunited. \nWhile they were gathering equipment for that camping trip, they stumbled across the metaverse yet again but this time, it's used to steal the desires from innocent people to affect them in the real world. \nThe Phantom Thieves of hearts are back from their hiatus and ready to get those stolen desires back!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nUnlike the other persona spin-offs that were either turn based (like the main games) or 2d fighting games, this one is actually a hack and slay with persona traits in it like: \nweakness and resist, all out attacks, 1 more, debuffs and buffs, baton pass, the third eye, ambush and of course the ability to switch personas via wildcard (which is Joker). \nBut they also added many new things that are quite interesting like: \nbonds, master arts, showtimes, gaining personas by random drops, being able to use surroundings as an advantage and so on.\nThe dungeon crawling is also a big part of this game, so be prepared to slice through countless enemies while exploring the cognitive world!    \n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nWhat is there more to say? If you have played the main game, then you know every single persona Ost is a bop and this time it's no exception.\n\nYearning to hear some good old Persona classics come back, like \"rivers in the desert\" ? Fear not, this game won't let you down. \nYou want \"last surprise\" but more funky? Here you go buddy!\nYou want new Osts that slap ass? Well with axe to grind and daredevil, there's nothing you can do wrong. \nThrough the Legacy BGM Dlc which is available through the deluxe edition, it is also possible to change the Battle theme to another one of the previous games.\n\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nEven though I haven't played that much hack and slay in general, I still enjoyed this kind of experience. \nI think this game is a great addition to the persona franchise and a fresh take on the hack and slay genre. \nThe only thing I can recommend in addition is playing the main game before touching this game, to improve your understanding of the following story as well some parts of the gameplay.",

        "content": "[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i] and my twitch https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg\n\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is an action hack&slash spin-off/sorta sequel for the fantastic rpg, Persona 5, which sadly has not been released on PC, a game that fans will surely love even in a different gameplay style. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d [u]The good parts:[/u]\n+The same characters you loved in P5 are back with all their great chemistry. \n+Initially combat seems a mess but as you get deeper into it, especially on Hard, it gets quite fun and challenging at times. \n+Most of the music from P5 is back but there are some nice new songs as well.\n+Boss fights.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n-You need to play Persona 5 on PS4 else it will be incredibly hard to follow.\n-The story presentation is almost the same as the original P5 but with a different coating. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is in an odd spot for what it is. What I mean by that is, it does continue after the events of the original Persona 5 but the Royal version which is arguably much better is not canon in Strikers which puts it in a weird place. Unfortunately, you still need to play Persona 5 or Royal, to understand and appreciate the story and its characters. I say unfortunately but that isn't really a bad thing because you should 100% play the original games because they're amazing. \n\nNow onto Persona 5 Strikers story, you play as Joker again who returns for the summer vacation back to Shibuya. As he gets back together with the gang he again ends up in the prison where everything started in the original P5. He is warned that another calamity is about to happen just like before, even worse, and it's up to the Trickster to stop it again. \n\nThis time around you encounter Jails instead of Castles which are at their core the same but with a different skin/background. I won't spoil their nature but suffice to say they follow the same pattern, you roam around the maps which are more open now due to the nature of the gameplay, fight enemies, then the final boss, calling card all that, and repeat several times. Even the way the ending is presented is similar, you'll understand once you reach it. \n\nYou will meet new characters and some of them will even join your group to help you fight the upcoming calamity. As for the original cast, they're all back and they're all the same as you know and love them. Their presence is what makes the Persona 5 series great. Be warned though the game has a lot of dialogue in its full 45 hours and you'll be spending even an hour or more just listening and reading. \n\nStory rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs I've mentioned before P5S is a spin-off because this time around it's not a turn-based rpg anymore but an hack&slash with few rpg mechanics borrowed from the original game. \n\nThe core is there but simplified and turned into action. You roam around the maps, attack the enemies, and engage in combat but instead of turn-based, they now spread around the map and you basically Devil May Cry their ass using the Personas you gather or create which is the specific skill of the Trickster. The abilities and the Personas are the same but \"ported\" to live-action combat. What that means is besides slashing your way through huge waves of enemies, you can also use skills that you are familiar with in an aoe pattern. \n\nObviously, you will not be fighting alone and 3 of your preferred teammates will be there to assist you. They have their own AI and will use skills and attacks but you can switch to them and play as them if you want to which is highly encouraged especially on Hard. You cannot swap your teammates in combat, only outside, so make sure before a boss or tough sub-boss to be prepared who you have by your side. Their skills are also exactly the same as the original so you won't have to worry much about that if you played it. The spell combinations, technical damage, Persona, and enemy weakness are all back so really not much is changed at its core besides how combat is displayed. Boss fights are challenging on Hard but fair and they're really fantastic how they crafted and adapted the mechanics to the hack &slash style. \n\nAs P5S is no longer an rpg, all the bonds and talking and everything else you were used to in the original is gone or simplified. The bond system is a simple talent tree in which you spend points you gather progressively through the story and some side quests. Crafting Personas is also very simplified. If this were an actual rpg with mechanics improved from the original, it would've been an amazing experience but hey at least you can still cook stuff so that's a plus. \n\nGameplay rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nObviously, you can play the game with the English cast or the Japanese cast. I prefer Japanese games, set in Japan, to be played with their original voices, not dubs and I will always recommend it that way. Their voices fit well with their characters and if you played the original you'll feel right back at \"home\". The new cast also does a pretty great job at getting you emotionally invested. \n\nThe music is mostly from the original, which is of course, great, but there are some fantastic new tunes, especially the boss ones. As for the sound effects and everything else, all is good, no issues whatsoever. \n\nAudio rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nFor a console port, I can safely say it's a pretty good job. Not great, not perfect but still good considering this is the second Persona game on PC. It's still only locked to 60 FPS and there aren't that many graphical settings and as usual, the draw distances are weak but not much of an issue.  The game looks crisp in higher resolutions and details and combat effects and spells and whatnot are all nice to look at. \n\nThere are some crashes and it can be very annoying since there will be times where saving is very scarce and you just have to redo parts of the game or a long boss fight. Other than that, I have not encountered any other issues.\n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, then I don't think I can recommend Strikers but if you have there's absolutely no reason not to play it even if the gameplay is different. The characters you love are back and the story while similar in its beats, is still something nice to experience. \n\n[h1]Final score: 8/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Let me start by saying yes i do think this is a good game but it shouldn't be a 60$ game. Especially since almost everything is just reused assets from Persona 5. It's also not that great of a port either.\n\n- Random crashes \n- Broken Anti-Aliasing\n- No widescreen\n- Capped 60fps\n- Render distance is terrible there are a lot of object pop in's\n- Buggy cutscenes\n- Mouse sensetivity is screwed. You can either have the camera turn too fast or too slow. no inbetween.\n- Also the mouse camera movement feels broken at times\n- Mouse curser keeps appearing whenever there's a cutscene or a text box\n- Doesn't seem to fully utilize an SSD. Some loading take longer than they should.\n\nI repeat it's a good game. But it isn't worth 60$. If you wanna play it i recommend getting it for 40$ from a keysite or something. I'll change my review to a positive if the game actually fixed the issues above.",

Other than that if you like those musou games then you will enjoy this game but the adds actually can hit hard if you ignore them lol. My only complaint of the game is that it can easily just deteriorate to mashing the attack button and I don't know what i'm doing half the time. Maybe that will change after the third dungeon. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5/royal and wants more persona content and happens to like action rpg or musou elements. \n\nGameplay 8/10 \nMusic 10/10\nVisuals 9/10",

        "content": "After 36 hours in I can safely say that this is not the Persona 5 experience I was hoping to get. The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n",

And that a good thing. \nThe combat is fun and is solid musou action.\n\nthe world feels like a blend between musou and persona, open maps with parts to jump on or a city to explore and investigate. You wont get bored of the character interactions and when you enter the jail you can go where you want. Sneak up to a enemy and start the combat in a closed up environment that fixes the open musou combat from other Koei titles. Its more like a Jrpg.\n\nGraphics are great and the soundtrack is just phenominal. \nI have a lot of praise for this title and you should get it as fan of the series, Jrpgs or musou titles.\nits a perfect blend.\n\nNow sadly the game is not the best port. Long loading screens and sadly crashes.\nplus people having issues with fps and you cant play in full screen atm. (windowed works perfect).\n\nWith that said, i know they will fix it over time. And i'm here to review the game itself.\nIts a fantastic title.\n\nEnjoy the game !!",

        "content": "TDLR; Very fun gameplay but has only a decent story that gets the job done, has tedious grinding, and some pc port issues. \n\n\nBefore I start there're a few things I'd like to note. PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.",

        "content": "(Dungeon 5 issue fix below. I'll update when I finish the game to give my proper thoughts. Thanks for the help everyone ^^)\n\nNote: Explanation second paragraph !!!!\n\nFirstly, I want to say I've had a great time playing Strikers! While the combat can get repetitive, you'll never get tired of activating showtime, partner swap, or an all-out attack! The story (What I've been able to play) started a bit slow however picks up with great emotional scenes, bad-ass set pieces, and boss fights. I've enjoyed my stay up until now..... \n\nWe started with a few minor crashes, but was not too serious and only happened 3 times in my 47hr playthrough. Now though I am locked out of any story progression when completing the 5th jail. I can challenge the boss with no issue and win. When I finish the cut-scene afterwards, however, I am locked into an infinite loading black screen. I've tried multiple things and done the fight roughly 5 times now. I'm on Hard difficulty completing all side tasks and collecting all possible persona's my playthrough. Why's this important? because as of now I can't complete the game, making all the work up to this stage pointless...... \n\nPlease send suggestions to the discussion I've posted for other approaches and PLEASE FIX ATLUS/SEGA!!! I love this series and it hurts me to give an enjoyable game a negative review but I think this is the only way I can get my message across.",

        "content": "Sadly I can't recommend this at present.\n\nBut first, before getting to the very specific reasons why, some of the many positives:\n[list]\n[*]It's by far the best Warriors-type game out there. The idea to just fully remove the big mass combat maps sounds crazy and like it would completely break such a game, but it turns out it does just the opposite, it makes the combat able to use far more abilities and intricacies because there's only 20-30 enemies now, not 400-1000.\n[*]Persona 5 oozed style at every corner, and this carries the torch perfectly. Even the menus are - once again - overstylized to hell and back, the game is full of fancy animations, all fitting the theme.\n[*]Speaking of theme, wow the audio is even better than P5 or P5R. It really raises the bar for such games.\n[*]Combat is surprisingly challenging depending on difficulty chosen, because counters, interactions and avoidance have a lot of meaning and you can die in 2-3 hits if you use the wrong character at the wrong moment.\n[*]The story - as far as I can tell yet - is quite good, and easily blows anything any Warriors game has done before out of the water.\n[/list]\n\nSo, why no recommendation? Well, there's the problem that a significant amount of people experience quite frequent crashes to desktop. Sure, most games exhibit these for some hardware configurations but here it seems more that a majority see them, most people just rather rarely. And some people see them a lot. Also from reports around the web it seems those who have the accidentally released denuvoless version installed do [b]not[/b] suffer from these crashes. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is: You may want to hold off until they patch out Denuvo.",

        "content": "Bringing this game to Steam was a good move, but players really NEED the original Persona 5 or Royal first. Atlus should port that next to be fair. With that said:\n\nIf you're a Persona fan considering skipping this game because:\n\n1)It's not \"real Persona/Megaten\"\n2)It's not turn-based\n3)There is no Social Link/Dating mechanic\n4)It's not The Royal (Although please do not play this before at least vanilla P5)\n\n\nPLEASE reconsider. This is in every sense still a very Persona game.\n\n\nTo say this is not true Persona is the equivalent of saying Persona is not true SMT. They are in the same family and are loyal to the spirit of the series. P1 and P2 did not have social link too.\n\n\nTrust me when I say Atlus has gone to great lengths to ensure this game FEELS like a sequel to Persona 5.\n\n\nThis game is missing some elements which might disappoint Persona fans:\n\n-There is no social link/confidant\n-Persona fusions are extremely streamlined\n-The combat is (obviously) not turn-based\n-The calendar system is fully controlled by plot, nothing actually passes time\n-SP depletes SUPER fast in the early game, but after a couple dozen hours I've begun to appreciate spreading out skills cleverly with normal attacks and combos. Leaving the dungeon to regenerate has no time penalty but is a bit of a time waster, should just have an option to skip the animation entirely tbh\n\n\nDESPITE THIS:\n\n-There's an abundance of \"social-like\" events and cutscenes, they're just integrated into the plot\n-Some are actually optional and are nice breathers very loyal to Persona fashion. Some of these are also in the form of requests/sidequests.\n-There's also a Confidant-like system that applies only to the Phantom Thieves. It's mostly automatic but there are actions you can take to increase the rank further. Rather than 10 ranks with set bonuses, you gain points to invest in skills of your choosing\n-The Palaces (or \"Jails\") are pretty well designed from what I have played of them and are much longer compared to P5 to compensate for the shorter calendar. They are HUGE. Plenty of verticality in some parts and nice platforming.\n-Yes it's simplified, but fusions are still pretty fun and skill inheritance plays a role\n-BUFFS, buffs are still important in this game. If you're skilled you can chip away at bosses with low level.\n-The combat is stellar and definitely not a pushover, because the Persona menu stops time, it somehow still feels like Megaten, you're just not taking turns... Play the game on HARD if you have the guts for it, you'll feel like a boss when clutching bosses with 1HP left. A well prepared player can literally NUKE bosses without taking damage.\n-Being able to control all Phantom Thieves and swapping between them in combos feels great\n-There are many more areas to explore since this game covers a road trip, incuding P5's Shibuya\n-Early parts of each Jail kinda feel like Persona 4's Intel gathering segments, but here there's a percentage on screen so you know when there's actual progress (less guessing)\n\nIn the 4 days of early access (Pre-Order) I've had 2 crashes to desktop after a cutscene. It was very random and I barely had any other issue.\n\nTips (You can probably ignore this if you wanna go 100% blind but there's no story mentioned here):\n\n-FPS has 2 settings, 30 and 60fps, I believe you cannot unlock this.\n-If your computer can handle it, set the resolution scale to 2.0x or at least 1.5x. At 1.0 the game's antialiasing is nearly non-existant.\n-Use the tutorials menu! It's the only place you'll learn combos and they're **CRUCIAL**\n-Shops restock based on plot and battles too, not just the calendar! Always check when you return from the metaverse AND make sure you know what shops have what so you don't waste yen. (YES even the vending machine trash is VERY IMPORTANT in this game, mostly early tho)\n-Just like items are important, don't ignore cooking. It's very good.\n-Use BOND skillpoints wisely. Money and Shop Sale are very good, but all of them matter.\n-Upgrading the shop sale BOND skill will restock the shop, use this very wisely!\n-Revisiting Jails has value as the requests system makes a return",

        "content": "Looking cool, Joker!\n\nA really fun sequel to the original Persona 5, continuing the story 6 months after the original game, and mostly keeping up with the standards for story set by its predecessor, albeit retreading many of the same paths, leaving the plot extremely derivative of the original, though making up for that in strides with its characters!\n\nWith an action-based combat system similar to the Dynasty Warrior games, the classic Persona fusing mechanics, and a whole heap of style, the combat is a joy to experience, especially with each Phantom Thief bringing something unique to the table! \nDefinitely feeling a lot more like a Persona game than a Dynasty Warriors one.\n\nAlthough it is a shame that the social sim aspect of the original isn't present in this game, the cast and the story of this game is just as interesting! The story makes sure to show off the bonds the members of the Phantom Thieves have with each other, actually presenting them as a group of friends, something I feel the original was missing, and keeps much of the original presentation. Not quite reaching the same highs as the the original, but good nonetheless, carried almost entirely by its interesting and fun characters.\n\nUnfortunately the game comes with several technical issues. \nDue to the pandemic the English cast had to record their lines from home, and it really shows. While their performances are just as spectacular as in the original Persona 5, the audio quality and mixing is all over the place with certain lines being hardly audible, especially near the very beginning of the game, though it does get better and less noticeable as the game goes on.\nThe game also suffers from terrible aliasing and texture compression that makes it look like the image is built out of Minecraft blocks, and a faulty Anti-Aliasing solution that makes everything look smudged, including the text, which is a real shame because the UI and art of this game ooze style, just like Persona 5! The ability to increase render scaling does help to alleviate some of the issues, so marginally, the image quality can look better than on the PlayStation consoles.\nCoupled with a 60 FPS cap and no analogue movement support, makes this merely an OK port.\n\nThat is, [u][b]if the game works for you at all[/b][/u]. The version available for purchase right now is filled with many issues that directly inhibit your ability to play it. From infinite loading screens and constant crashes to just annoyingly long load times. With these severe issues seemingly being caused by the Denuvo DRM used for the game as the accidentally released DRM-Free version that came out with the Digital Deluxe edition pre-release suffers from none of these.\nAlthough users have found some supposed workarounds, the best way to fix this seems to be to somehow acquire the DRM-Free version of the executable.\n\nIf you are able to overcome the constant crashing and infinite loading times, the rest of these issues are easy to look past though with the fast paced action, charming characters, and the fun times you'll have with the Phantom Thieves in this sequel!\n\n[spoiler] Haru best girl.

In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.",

        "content": "I've put a lot of hours into both Warriors games and Shin Megami Tensei games - and I enjoyed the original Persona 5, so I was excited to play Strikers. Now, having beaten the game, I can say that Strikers is one of the stronger games in its genre.\n\nThe gameplay of Strikers makes it a very enjoyable game. The game mixes the beat-em-up gameplay of Warriors games and the adventure gameplay of Persona, with some sprinkling of what feels like an Ys game. You'll progress through dungeons fighting Shadow after Shadow as the Phantom Thieves, and is what you'll spend most of your time doing. Each member of the Phantom Thieves have distinct skills and fighting styles, with my favorites being Inari's ice/counter and Noir's Psi/Gun fighting styles. This hasn't been the first time Persona has taken a step out of the comfort zone, and this game does it well. Unfortunately, this gameplay change also does away with the day-to-day life-sim aspect that Persona's iconic for in favor of a more linear schedule - time won't progress until you do the objective. This in turn removes the Confidant system (in favor of Bond XP leveling system), so any character-fleshing-out is going to only happen during the story. This isn't a huge turn-off for me, but for how much this game feels like just an action-Persona title, it's a shame that sort of thing wasn't included.\n\nStrikers is also very strong aesthetically. It hasn't changed much from Persona 5, but that isn't a bad thing. Exploring the dungeons, while admittedly formulaic at times, remains enjoyable over the 30 hour journey due to not only the enjoyable combat, but also due to varying environments and soundtrack. New songs add to the ambiance of dungeon exploration, while remixes of old Persona 5 favorites pumping energy into the combat. Like its predecessor, Strikers is very strong stylistically.\n\nFor better or for the worse, the story is very much what you would expect from an SMT game - [spoiler]  teenagers fighting ever stronger enemies until they kill god [/spoiler]. Still, I think the strongest parts of an SMT story is represented in its characters. While the Phantom Thieves have their time to shine, much more of the spotlight is given to new characters Sophia and Zenkichi, so it's a good thing these characters are likable.  I found Sophia to be very adorable and good comic relief, with Zenkichi being even stronger comic relief. It's a shame they get more of a focus than the original team, but they're well written enough to be enjoyable elements of the story.\n\nThis game is not standalone; I do not think you can play Strikers without expecting to be spoiled with the plot of Persona 5. Various plot elements of the previous game are talked about in Strikers - such as plot and ending elements of Persona 5, or retroactively spoil the original game - why are characters in the original game not in this one? If you're already familiar with the plot of the original or Royal or don't care about being spoiled, you can jump right in, but otherwise I cannot recommend this as the starting point of Persona 5 newcomers.\n\nThe one major gripe I have with Strikers is the sole technical issue I've had with the game - the crashes. Roughly during every session I play the game - after about two to four hours - the game will crash, usually during a transition between dungeons and Japan or traveling to/from the Velvet room. I save rather aggressively, so I basically never lost any progress, but if you're worried about that sort of thing and rely on autosaves you should probably wait for a future patch.\n\nTLDR: Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5, featuring charming characters, engaging combat, and a great aesthetic. Any fan of both of Persona and Warriors based combat is sure to enjoy this game, but people who haven't yet experienced Persona 5 or wary of crashes should purchase in the future instead.",

I won't say I enjoy the battles as much as in original entry, but I do feel more immersed in the battles (also, sometimes AI does some crazy shit and you must fight 1 vs boss, which I find quite confusing).  Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game. It would be VERY preferable to play Persona 5 Royal or Persona 5 before playing this to better understand the plot and how the game world works, but it's not on PC (yet?). \n\nP.S. This review is based in the first 10 hours of the game. I'll update it when I finish it",

While the Dynasty Warriors gameplay may be generic or old to some, to me, its something I played when i was really young so its something very special to me no matter how generic it may be. \nThe characters here feel the same as what they did in Persona 5 though a little more mature but still making them more unique from one another like Yusuke and Ryuji.

        "content": "NOTE: to those who may be stuck on the initial loading screens when opening the game: Hit Alt+Enter to change the game from Windowed Mode to Fullscreen, or vice versa. I found it worked for me.\n\nSome background. I've played P3FES, P4G, and P5 vanilla, and I was so excited for this game. However, If you're looking for an RPG experience like the typical persona games, you won't find it here. It is a more \"on the rails\" linear storyline. That being said, if you enjoy hack and slash gameplay or are invested in the characters, I can't reccomend the game enough. All the praises I could say about the game, you will likely hear from the others. What I do want to do is give some notes for those who are on the fence about the game/wonder about technicalities about the PC port.\n\nSome notes:\n       - As many have noted, this game has a LOT going on at once on your screen. The combat starting out will be clunky, stiff, and a bit challenging at first. You could say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this game. But give it some time and you'll eventually learn to filter out the noise and navigate battles like an expert. Making use of your dash and your special (Y button on the controller) will allow for some of the most fluid combat I've gotten a chance to play in a hack and lash.\n\n       - This game is an anti aliasing nightmare. If you can, before starting a new game, turn on anti aliasing and crank up the resoulution scale to 2.0. In classic persona fashion, you won't be able to access the pause menu until you get through the tutorials.\n\n        - This game is locked to 60fps. It's a real shame considering I wanted to make full use of my 144hz monitor, but we'll have to see if we'll get a community mod for that, or if it's set to 60 because the game logic will break because of a high framerate.\n\n        - The voice mixing in this game is kind of horrendous. Characters sound different (especially joker) and in some parts, voices are too quiet, like the VAs were standing too far away from the microphones. Still, this is an amazing feat considering that all of the voicework was recorded from home due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n        - The battles are fairly easy for me, and I've played only a few hack and slash's growing up. If you are a hack and slash expert, I'd put the difficulty on \"hard\". You are free to change the difficulty whenever you wish during the game.\n\n        -  There is a lot of reading, like traditional persona games. If you're not into that, you may want to give picking this up a second thought.  If you have never played Persona 5, I reccomend watching a playthrough or playing it yourself before jumping into this game as it does not give much background into the plot of P5.\n\nThis game is a whole lot of fun, and I want to thank the developers at Atlus for putting in the time to port this game to PC. Here's hoping for the other persona games to come to PC!",

Other than this the game runs perfectly smooth at 1080 and 60fps High without the need of a really powerful graphics card, so it's an easy buy if you have the recommended specs for it. Even during battle with a ton of enemies in the screen it never stuttered or lagged so you don't have to worry about its' perfomance.",

There were some minor issues upon first launching it but they disappeared after restarting. The default key bindings are also very disgusting, definitely change them before starting the game as you can not change them while playing on a save :/ I ended up locking myself in the tutorial mission because I had \"gun\" assigned to Tab and \"lock-on\" assigned to Alt...yeah you can probably see the problem there.\n\nOther than that, just like every Persona game the characters/soundtrack/story are amazing! It's a lot of fun being able to play as other characters aside from Joker. There's a fuck ton of new mechanics in this game compared to all the previous games so you will have plenty to do/work on.\n\nHowever...from what I heard there is one major downside to this game...[b]why can I not romance best girl Makoto?? or any character for that matter?[/b]",

        "content": "I came in to persona 5 strikers having played persona 5 (the original, not royal) and beaten it on a PS4. While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future. We're glad to have you here! \n\nBest Regards, -PR0XIDIAN",

        "content": "[h1]-Overall Opinion-[/h1]\n\nThis is genuine Persona DNA through and through, even though the combat system is different. If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

        "content": "As a fan of Persona 4 and 5, i cannot recommend this. Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored. If you like this kind of games - give it a shot.",

        "content": "The unexpected persona game to say the least but ATLUS did a very good job of keeping this game, well... still in the theme of Persona.\n\n[h1] Combat Mechanics [/h1]\nTo be simple, Turn-based JRPG turn Real-Time.\nA lot combat aspects are still there, surprisingly. Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.",

So when I heard that P5 was getting the musou treatment? I just had to buy it. All 29 hours I have so far, and I've only just begun the third dungeon. I love this game to death and will sing it's highest praises to anyone who will listen. My only gripe with it though is that it isn't musou enough for me, and the ambush mechanic seems a tad overpowered in this. A couple of friends have told me that bumping up the difficulty alleviates that some, but I can personally manage. I just wish we could of gotten tons of shadows on screen at once like you do in some fights instead of those you quickly ambush, push one button, and then instantly win the fight.",

        "content": "FIRST OF ALL A WARNING:\n[b]DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PERSONA 5 ALREADY AND ARE STILL PLANNING TO AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE! THIS GAME NOT ONLY CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, BUT ALSO BUILDS DIRECTLY ON THE PLOT OF P5 AND HEAVILY REFERENCES IT![/b]\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what a Persona Veteran and someone who's played through both P5 *and* P5R twice respectively, thinks of P5S so far:\n\nBiggest and most obvious change compared to the main series game is the combat system; instead of using the incredibly perfect turn-based combat approach from the main series, Strikers instead uses a realtime buttonmashing/Dynasty Warriors-ish kind of approach.\n\nWhen I first heard that, I was pretty disappointed, because Persona and turn-based just go hand in hand, and for very good reason.\n\nAfter having played it for myself, the first two hours or so I was still pretty on the fence, because it really was mostly button-mashing, and as I expected, the camera is a major hassle unless you lock on to a single enemy within a crowd of dozens.\n\nThe good news however is that it does get somewhat better over time, i.e. with story progress; you'll get environmental interactables that allow for special attacks, ranging from dashing onto a  lamp post to slide down with a wild spin-kicking tornado attack, to jumping on skateboards and just mowing down entire platoons of enemies, or even using stuff like oversized party poppers to bombard them from a distance.\nSo what the combat system lacks in tactical depth and detailed strategic combat gameplay, it reasonably makes up for in crazy and fun blowing-off-steam kind of combat escapades.\n\nAs for the story, it stays true to what we've seen in Persona 5, being a very well-written narrative with deeply emotional moments, philosophical questions, plot twists, as well as an overall theme that carries through 'til the end.\n\nI won't go into further details for obvious spoiler reasons, but suffice it to say that if you've loved P5's story, then'll you'll probably love P5:S's just the same, especially since the characters themselves reference a lot of the main storyline's key moments, and reminisce about the nostalgia of it all at pretty much the same time as you, the player, get that very same nostalgic feeling about encountering the main cast again.\n\nThe new members of the Phantom Thieves are also very intriguing and very well written (though one more so than the other, in my opinion), so look forward to discovering just what these two wil become over the course of the 25 - 35 hours of playtime.\nAll in all, this really feels much more like an addon to P5, story-wise, if not gameplay-wise, rather than \"just\" a spin-off.\n\nThere is some bad news too, however, namely in the [b]total lack of social/time management gameplay[/b] that is so typical of the Persona main series games.\nStrikers, sadly, is 100% linear, and fully scripted ... there's only one singular instance in the entire game where you can actually choose with whom to go on a ferris wheel ride, and that's it.\nNo romance, no confidants, nothing.\n\nThe same, equally sadly, goes for the Requests; compared to Persona 5 proper, in Strikers they are really, really uninspired, with 90+ percent consisting of generic fetch quests, or equally generic \"Kill X of Y in Z\" quests.\n\nAs I said (yelled from the rooftops :P) in the beginning, in my opinion, this game should only be played if you've already played through Persona 5 on console.\n\nIf you haven't yet, much of this game won't make much sense to you... you won't get any of the \"en passant\"-references, you won't really understand the major story references in highly emotional moments, and you don't even know the main cast at all, since Strikers doesn't bother to (re-)introduce them, instead expecting you to already know who they are, what they went through, how they became Phantom Thieves... you'd basically get thrown into a road trip of a group of extremely tight-knit friends whom you've never seen before in your life.\n\nAnd, again, the most important warning goes out to those of you who are still planning to play P5 eventually, maybe waiting for a potential PC release, or until they can afford console or game, or whatever:\n\n[b]Do _not_ play P5:S beforehand, it _will_ ruin large parts of the Persona 5 story and experience for you![/b]",

Character writing/voice acting is a real delight, the game's combat is a fantastic blend of action-RPGs (not unlike KH2 with its Reaction Commands) and the Persona series. It's not really in the same vein as FFVII Remake, but I like the combat system here for very similar reasons to that game. Compared to other Persona spin-offs in the past, this one for sure is a definite sequel through-and-through beyond the actual plot. If you've played the original before, this isn't worth missing out on.\n\nalso sophia is adorable and i care for her",

The only complaint, if any is that the camera could've used a little more work but the counter to that is a lovable/colorful cast, fun battle system, and fun side indulgences like cooking (I do love my cooking mechanics). Honestly, not the most in-depth review but for someone who has entered the P5 universe with this game, I am having a lot of fun; definitely recommended!",

        "content": "Wow, So, you get THE TEAM. You know? THE TEAM! Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it. They tried to merge two different worlds and ending failing both of them. Which is sad cause i really do love these phantom thieves.\n\nThanks & Good Luck\n\n",

Port is rubbish: 3 to 4 minutes to start the game every time (as in, staring at a black screen for said several minutes before even the LOADING ICON appears), long load times during the game proper (15 to 20 seconds), which according to some sites: apparently stem from having installed DLC and Digital Deluxe Content. So don't buy those if you want manageable load times. In my case though, loading is still exactly as slow even after removing the DLC and uninstalling from HDD reinstalling the game unto my SSD. \n\nOn a whim, I heard that downgrading the drivers to your video card might help matters, so I decided to log into GeForce Experience; and before I started downgrading I started up the game and this time the game loaded in TEN SECONDS! Excited, I exited the game and started it again, hoping that solved the problem but nope. It was back up to 3 to 4 minutes of black screen before the game loaded again. What the hell? What the ACTUAL hell? Everything was literally the same when I started the game both those times in that short span of time. Why.\n\nI'm not the only one with this problem, and there are many others with various issues regarding crashing after long dungeons and the like. These issues/bugs may be address by a patch in the future but for right now: literally play any other version of Persona 5 Strikers instead of this one.",

        "content": "A great sequel to Persona 5, and one of the best games the musou subgenre has to offer. P5\u2019s stylish and bold aesthetic perfectly mixes well with the musou genre. The Phantom Thieves\u2019 attacks are consistent to their original kit and are fluid. The new showtime attacks look awesome and are satisfying to use when facing a large enemy mob. Persona skills are still available and give you some time to breath during a battle, maintaining some of the turn-based mechanics from the original game. I feel more encouraged to switch between party members in this game since all of them have much higher utility in this game compared to the original game, where I would have a set party for a majority of the game. The persona elements help make the game feel less repetitive in combat since there\u2019s plenty of combos, abilities, and party members to try and use, which is a problem that plagues games in this subgenre.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves finally get some quality time together as they traverse across Japan to, which was much needed in the original game (looking at you Haru). There are plenty of moments during this road trip for fans of the game to enjoy. Zenkichi and Sophia are awesome additions to the main cast and have some of the most compelling character arcs in Persona 5. Villains in this game are more sympathetic than their P5 counterparts since most villains in Strikers were originally well-intentioned people before being twisted due to certain events. It\u2019s a welcome change.\nThe lack of social links is disappointing. Confidant abilities get replaced with bond skills that are useful, but very grindy to accumulate the points to maximize the skills without the dynamic building between Joker and the confidant. Most of the cast from P5 are nowhere to be referenced, which kinda sucks. I would\u2019ve at least liked the cast to mention how some of the side characters were spending their time in this game as a fan, but it\u2019s ultimately a neutral exclusion.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a game I\u2019d highly recommend to people who played Persona 5/Royal. Fans would enjoy seeing the Phantom thieves enjoy their quasi-summer vacation and more moments from their favorite members. Would I recommend it to people who have not played Persona 5 or Royal? Probably not since it\u2019s a direct sequel, but gameplay wise, it\u2019s one of the best musou games for sure.",

        "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.",

        "content": "[h1]This game is Amazing but not without flaws ( well the flaws are more due to the port and not the game itself )[/h1]\n\n[b]Persona 5 Strikers shows that Musou can still feel fresh and that Atlus is not done suprising us.[/b]\n\n[h1]The gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is basically a mix between Musou ( Warriors ) style games ( Dynasty warriors, one piece pirate warriors etc. ) and the core formula of Shin Megami Tensei / Persona.\n\nYou'll have your basic Musou combos by combining \u25a3 and \u25b3 and in addition to that you can use your Persona and their abilities. \nThe gameplay may seem pretty basic at first but when you start facing strong enemies on higher difficulties you will need to switch between your Persona to have the right resistance against the attack you're about to receive, switch to a Persona that can exploit the enemy weakness, use \"technical skills\" by inflicting a status ailment on the enemy and then using a skill that benefits from that ailment etc.\n\nDuring your fights you'll be able to use your environment to attack your enemies in different way as well as dodge incoming attacks. Certain bosses have special interactions with some of these environmental attacks, but i wont spoil anything there you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nIn contrary to a standard Musou game you don't have zones to capture, it's closer to Persona in the fact that you engage a shadow and a group of enemy spawn ( of course you can ambush them like in Persona 5 ).\n\nThe bosses are pretty fun but they are sponges, they have a lot of hp and the fights can get a bit long ( but Persona has the same problem ).\n\nThe palaces are not very memorable and some of them are downright annoying.\n\nI recommend progressing through the game on max difficulty so you can actually see and use all the mechanics it has to offer and only use the Easy difficulty when you have to grind because some things take forever to get ( for example bond level in the post game ).\n\n[h1]The story and the characters[/h1]\nThe story is decent, it's not as good as a mainline entry but it's good enough to get you hooked.\nYou'll follow the Phantom thieves on a trip to different Japanese cities to clear their palaces ( called Jails in the game ), the interactions with the other characters are fun but you wont have the depth of other Persona games and their social links because this mechanic is not in the game, it's replaced by a general bond level which you gain points for by fighting, doing certain quests and spending time with the characters. ( yes this means you can't romance futaba the best girl )\n\nThe characters include the ones we all know and love from Persona 5 and it's nice to spend some time with them again.\nThe new characters are also nice and pretty well written .\n\nthe antagonists, their story and motives are decent.\n\n[h1]The art[/h1]\nThe game looks just like Persona 5 so i don't have too much to say about that, if you like the graphical style of P5 you'll love Strikers'.\nThe animations are nice and fluid and every character has different animations inside and outside of combat.\nThe all out attacks and Showtime are nice and flashy and different between each characters.\n\n[h1]The soundtrack[/h1]\nThe Japanese voice acting is very good ( i didn't try the english one ).\nThe musics are by the same singer as Persona 5's musics and they are really freakin' good. Some are subjectively better than what we got in Persona 5 such as What You Wish For or Daredevil.\nThe sounds in the fights are similar to what we've seen in Persona 5, down to when Joker calls a persona.\n\n[h1]How long to beat ?[/h1]\nStrikers is much shorter than the other Persona entries, in 43.4Hrs in beat the game once in Hard difficulty and once on Merciless in NG+. I've read all the text, participated in all the events i could, finished the inmate registry and got all the success on Steam.\nThis doesn't make it worse than other entries, if you were not a fan of how much Slice of Life stuff there was in other Persona games you'll prefer the direction of Strikers, there's still filler stuff but it's way more focused on the story and gameplay.\n\n[h1]My main complaints with the game[/h1]\nAt its current state the game sometimes crashes during loadings ( i got about 10 crashes in my playtime which is not a lot but it's still annoying, especially after a hard fight )\n\nFarming bond experience is a pain in the ass, it takes forever if you don't use exploits.\nKeep in mind that you can use an exploit to \"bypass\" the bond experience issue and i did use it.\nFarming Persona Points to level up your Persona is also really annoying, it's not hard because you just have to unsummon a persona and resummon it from the registry over and over but the process is really long and boring, even with the Persona that give the most points.\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nIf you have played and enjoyed Persona 5, go for it without thinking, except if you hate action-rpg. You'll have a blast.\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, i'd say to play it first because in Strikers they don't introduce the characters that are from regular P5, they assume you already know them. Also they reference some events that took place in P5.\n\n[h1]Any plans for Persona 3 FES and Persona 5 Royal atlus ?[/h1]",

        "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5",

I thought it would be like the other Dynasty Warriors games (Hyrule Warriors for example) but boy am I wrong do I love the gameplay. It really blends in classic Persona elements with action fighting mechanics from Dynasty Warriors and it works really well that you can have a lot of fun with the gameplay and use it to your advantage during boss fights and all. \n\nNow if only Atlus releases Persona 5 Royal on Steam I would be a happy man. But this game is still worth buying for sure!",

Definitely worth your money :)",

        "content": "After playing for a while I can say that it's definitely more like a sequel than a spin-off. The sim life is indeed less present, but the charms of the characters still shine the same. The combat is fine, but the game doesn't blow me away like the original (and certainly Royal) did, but it is certainly entertaining enough. Indeed, it's worthy of calling it a Persona 5 sequel rather than a spin-off as the story literally picks up where the original ended and it feels like a warm homecoming (literally) from digital friends you've been missing.\n\nIt is great that another studio manages to capture Persona 5's style so well, even though it is a lot less in-depth. For example, I liked the sim-life part of Persona 5 the most and the turn-based combat a bit less. Although I normally prefer action-based combat, I liked the combat better in the original as it feels a bit messy in Strikers. The attacks don't really feel they have a lot of impact and your super attacks (like in the original) deal the most damage. But they cost a lot of SP, but this may become a bit more balanced if you get a little further in the game and have collected more upgrades.\n\nDespite the sequel being 'not as good' as the original, it certainly doesn't make it bad. The charm of Persona 5 is just as strong and the combat is entertaining enough. Despite the fact that the sim-life aspect is less present, it is fortunately still somewhat there. But to see your friends with the same great voice actors just feels good and it is very entertaining to go on an adventure together again.\n\nI wanted to share my opinion about it, but I have to say it keeps getting better. Even though I've been playing for a couple of days, I'm taking it easy and I've finished only the first chapter by now and recently started on the second one. But I can certainly say this. For those who've played Persona 5 and are absolutely craving more, here's your sequel that's definitely worthy of it.",

        "content": "Ever since I played vanilla persona 5 about 2 years ago, I've been sucked into this series and have loved every second of it. As a big fan, seeing strikers get a PC port meant more persona on PC and an instant buy from me. As expected, I am not disappointed. This combat, while it does take a while to master, is extremely addicting and is the highlight of the game so far for me. The story is entertaining as well, and travelling across a bunch of cities with the gang is a vibe. As this is the first game in the P5 universe on steam, playing it just really makes me want Persona 5 Royal on steam that much more. Seeing my favorite game get the port that everyone has been begging for would really be like a dream.  As for this game, if you're a fan its a must buy, but for others you do need to play vanilla persona 5 to understand anything in this game.",

The main game of Persona 5 will need to be played to understand the world, but this is nothing but a benefit since the game doesn't need to waste any time exploring the old cast. The story is very fun, the new characters are very welcome additions, the gameplay is addictive, and the soundtrack of course is godly. I can't recommend this enough to anybody who even slightly enjoyed Persona 5.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

        "content": "Cleared the game (as of 03.25.2021) but will keep the review spoiler free.\n\nPros\n- A legit continuation of P5 (not P5R). The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.",

        "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5. The world needs more Persona games.",

Tweaking it in the nVidia control panel fixes it completely and makes the game a wonder on the eyes. It's a shame that it has to be done, though, since that probably means the port quality is scrappier than I would've liked, but at least it's a relatively small and easy thing to tweak.\n\nOtherwise, the game's pretty solid so far. I'm surprised at how \"Persona\" it is, since I was certain that it was gonna be a Warriors game, with stages and missions, that just happens to have a Persona skin. Much to my surprise, it's not. I mean, it's certainly a Warriors' game, but not a 1:1 skin.\n\nEDIT: Also, remake Persona 3 and put it on PC pls.",

The menu screens, transitions, animations are all amazing.\n3. The fight scenes feel very fluid while sticking to the Persona game theme very well. \n4. The story, this might be a personal preference, but I really do love the story. \n5. Mechanical skills and awareness feels rewarding. Dodging at the right time, using the right abilities on the right targets at the right time, it all rewards you in spades.\n\nI have some pet peeves with the game, albeit not enough to stop me from enjoying the game. \n1. The jagged lines and horrendous AA implementation kind of bothers me at times\n2. I can't find as many sort orders as the other games, kind of makes things harder to search for, when you want to search for a specific persona.\n3. Not sure if this is a bug, but there one time when two of the AI controlled members just flat out AFK'd mid fight. And then the other used abilities repeatedly which kinda sorta just healed the shadows. Forcing me to fight in a different way. (It happened just once to my knowledge and hasn't happened ever since, still, always in the back of my mind.)\n\n\nTL;DR, My grading for P5S\nVisuals          9/10  -  The game is a literal piece of art\nMusic            9/10  -  Some of the best game scores you can find \nCharacters    9/10  -  They will end up as a part of you. \nGameplay     8/10  -  Enjoyable\nStory             8/10  -  Engaging",

The music rocks, the gameplay is surprisingly engaging and somewhat difficult. The style helps encapsulate a feeling of badass combat. And the story is fun, nothing mind blowing from what I've played, but it doesn't have to be, it knows what it wants to be, and I think it achieves what it sets out to do very well. If you like P5 and fast based combat and exploration, get this game, it's just more time with your favorite characters with a new gameplay style that kicks ass!",

        "content": "Tl;dr: Great game, not just a Musou clone, well worth checking out.\n\nA worthy successor to Persona 5 and highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the original.\n\nRight out the gate, it's important to note that this is a rather different game to Persona 5 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The fighting got a new dynamic to it, and is entertaining throughout the whole game. \n\nNow the negatives:\n-The gameplay is a bit tedious. (Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it. Not the perfect game, but worth it non the less. I reccomend you to play the base game quickly (with it's 150 hours of gameplay :D) before buying this game, so the story fascinates you even more.",

        "content": "While this game's combat mechanics are fun and fresh in their divergence from Persona's normal turn-based gameplay, the story (while it has its moments) is a boring retread of material from past Persona games, and apart from the fanservice for players of Persona 5 I can't recommend this game on the merits of its narrative. The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat.\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively. Aight yall be good people and WEAR YO MASK!",

Sure, there are still mindless waves of fodders for you to smash them away, but they also implement tactical RPG stuff really nicely. You will find yourself planning the fight surprisingly a lot more than that. Most systems from Persona series are coming back and fit in really nicely (Elemental weakness, One-more, All-out-attack, Showtime.) It feels not out of place and keep it very true to the lore of Persona 5 in every aspect from gameplay, design, theme, and world's logic.\n\nOne thing that can be see as a downside is P5S is the direct continuation of Persona 5 (with some references to P5R too.) And it's not a small side story but pretty much a full fledged saga. They do try to rush out some of quick recap in the first hour but people without experience of  Persona 5 can find this sudden insertion to technical stuff too absurd for them. Is it needed? Not really. But your reaction would be \"Oh! I remember that! Nice!\" every thirty seconds to \"WTF just happened?\" based on your exposure to Persona franchise. Still a great game, but ATLUS and SEGA should really considered boosting this game with the Persona 5 Royal release on PC.",

        "content": "Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei by extension, have a pretty sizeable barrier to entry when it comes to engaging players. Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you. Whether that itch is worth scratching is up for you to decide.",

I would NOT recommend it if you haven't played Persona 5 for two reasons: 1. The game is a sequel to P5 so you wont really get most of the references or relationships. And 2. PERSONA 5 IS AMAZING AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT PLAYING IT. All jokes aside, this game is really fun, once you get into the flow of combat, it is really enjoyable. It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.",

        "content": "10/10 game, now keep it up and bring of the Persona franchise to PC.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a step in a brand new direction for the entire Persona franchise, yet entirely fits all of the knowledge we currently have on the series. Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.",

        "content": "I've logged over 160 hours into Persona 5, it's in my top 3 favourite games. It's so cool to see a direct sequel with a similar concept. It's very fun to see this game take place in an action Musou format rather than an RPG. It kind of adds to the immersion in a way. Super charming to see the gang back together stealing twisted desires. Something I appreciate about this game is that it's not *just* a Warriors game, but it really feels like a bite sized Persona game with the life sim mechanics. Persona on PC in general is eye candy and super convenient to just boot up since I'm usually using my computer every day.",

        "content": "I haven't met many people in recent years who hadn't heard of Persona 5 in some fashion. Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus. Well done, Omega Force.",

        "content": "I would give this a neutral review if I could and rate it a generous 3/5. It isn't bad but it also does nothing good. This is a spin off of the original Persona 5 release and really only performs well at giving more screen time to the cast. You could play this without first playing Persona 5 but it would be pretty pointless. The story isn't that good and neither is the gameplay. You are here for the cast you wouldn't even know. This also does not follow Persona Royal and the new character from that version is not here.\n\nNone of the side characters from Persona 5 are in the game outside of Sojiro at the very start and end of the game. None of your favorites from the social links return at best you might get one line of internal monologue from Joker acknowledging their existence. One other character does show up for maybe 10 lines and that's it. \n\nSocial links themselves do not exist. Bonding points are here which you can use to level up skills that unlock during the main story. It's basically just a bar that goes up from pretty much anything you do without the main reason we did social links in the first place. Romance does not happen here but there are two bonding points in the game. But they are quickly forgotten and never mentioned again. \n\nThe story is average at best. Basically a rework of Persona 5 with more changing of hearts. If you've ever played a JRPG or watched anime you likely can see where it is going. Entirely forgettable and just an excuse to bring the cast back together. This could be more forgiven if the gameplay was great but...\n\nThe Shin Megami Tensei series perfected turn based combat many years ago with the Press Turn system. Persona 5 being an actual spin off of the main series uses a modified system of it. Strikers throws out all of that for an action system combined with musou elements. The main issue is it is incredibly repetitive and gets boring quickly. Each character has a few basic combos, their gun and their persona abilities. They also each learn 4 arts from continuing to use them further making them more useful and unique. But the kicker is you are now using all this up against the musou style of gameplay with tons of waves of enemies. It starts interesting but quickly overstays its welcome. Regular mobs are fairly weak but mini and especially bosses are HP sponges. The weakness abuse/critical hits/technical hits all carries over but it just isn't much fun. After the second jail I lowered the difficulty from hard to easy just so I could see the story.\n\nThere are two new characters joining the cast. Both fit in nicely and enjoyed their dialogue during the story. They are even better in combat though. I would say they might be to good and you might not want to leave them out in favor of your past favorites.\n\nThere is no time management in this game so you can freely leave the dungeon at any point. But it is like no one bothered to play test the game. You can leave from any checkpoint to restore your HP/SP and even warp back to that same point. So why not just make the checkpoint restore these things without wasting our time leaving and coming back? SP itself is scarce at the start of the game. The further you go in the main story the more bond skills you unlock to increase ways of restoring it. But it should just naturally recover from using normal attacks.\n\nThe voice acting (Japanese at least) is great and so is the music. Several music remixes and I look forward to getting the OST. The game is just as stylish as Persona 5 from menus to the actual combat.\n\nThe PC port is not that great. I myself had three crashes in my near 32 hours but I hear some people had it way worse. The graphical options are bugged and you'd need to tweak them outside of the game. Also the game is locked at a max 60 fps but the cutscenes run at 30 fps which is very noticeable.",

        "content": "[h1] Persona 5 Strikers completed review [/h1]\n\n[h1] Disclaimer [/h1]\nThis is not a spin-off of Persona 5, this is a sequel. For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b]. HEE-HO!",

I loved the story, the characters old and new, the English voice acting which I am so glad Atlus waited until the English cast finished their recording despite the pandemic (Taylor Harvey playing persona 5 strikers\u2019s Sophie is such a great fit).  Finally the message Persona 5 strikers delivers. From the start I had worries of it being very slow pace due to how it set up. But once it kicks in. Oh it kicks in all right.  \n\nAs for the gameplay. For me personally the warriors style game play does get a bit repetitive during the ending just spamming magic and just using sp items to do more magic rinse and repeat but as a Dynasty Warriors fan. It\u2019s just so much fun. I really enjoyed it and would recommend those who are fans of persona to try it out or those who are interested in the warriors famoula (just a warning might want to start on hard since normal feels far too easy). Sure it\u2019s not your jrpg but for the plot and message it brings. Persona 5 Strikers is really worth the pick up. \n\nFinished it with all achievement done and would do it again. I might just come back for it for a merciless run but as of right now the show\u2019s over \ud83d\ude0a highly recommend. Thanks, you Koei, Omega Force, Sega and Atlus for bringing such a masterpiece over to the west.  Now where is my persona 5 strikers 2 because I crave please, persona 4 or 3 strikers anyone?",

        "content": "It's quite excellent.\n\nIf you really enjoyed Persona 5, you probably already picked this up.  If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is still Persona, but instead of Turn based you get Warriors-style hack-n-slash battles. Atlus and Koei really made this game work amazingly, perfectly translating the persona 5 battles into warriors style. The game just as stylish and the writing is just as good, if not better then Royals. All the new music and remixs feel great and unique while still feeling the same. Although the game has some issues running on PC, it still runs well enough to play. The Digital Deluxe in-game DLC I find really adds to the game having the older music from the series' past. Although the Deluxe's bonus content is just a unity project, which means you don't get the soundtrack directly as music files. Atlus actually updating this game on PC to make it more stable is great, just wish they'd fix the optimization issues it has.",

Sure, the combat is different from the original but I promise you, if anything, the change is nice. \nThis game still has an absolute bunch of story and cutscenes for you to enjoy, just like the original game. I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be very story driven and expected much more of a dynasty warrior style all the way through, I'm glad I was wrong on that one though. While I recommend playing/watching the original Persona 5, you can still play this game without knowing it, you'll just be a little confused or oblivious to some references.\nI'd say if you want just story, it's about 30-ish hours but to complete it (achievements, etc.) would be more like 50. Less content than in the original, but expected.\nThe new characters that are introduced fit the team perfectly and I really like how every single member has their own unique way of fighting, it's fun to change it up here and there. One of my favourite parts is that you can play as any of the cast (you'll always be Akiren/Joker for the social stuff and for main story, though) and they all have their own unique animations and cutscenes, it's just a whole lot of fun all the way through.\nI am the same as everyone else hoping that Atlas decide to port P5/P5R to steam, but for now, this is a really nice way to scratch the itch for Persona players and fans alike.",

        "content": "So, how do I start with this review?\nHalf an hour ago, after 60 hours of playing I finally finished P5Strikers and I am blown away. I LOVED P5 on the PlayStation 4 (didn't play P5R yet, ATLUS, PLS BRING IT ON PC, I BEG YOU) and I do love P5Strikers even more, kinda. Although I couldn't build my romance-ship with Futaba, like in P5...\n\nThe gameplay is in my opinion not just like a normal ''Warriors''-Hack and Slash-kinda gameplay, it is basically a combination of using your Persona-Skills correctly or in the right situation and more or less just smashing your 2 attack-buttons. For those, who like the ''Warriors''-games, you will DEFINITELY love this piece of indescribable and beautiful art. The ''Hack and Slash''-Combat doesn't feel boring nor repetitive, like in the original ''Warriors''-series, which is because of the HUGE variety of Personas you can have (just like in the original P5) and how ATLUS/Koei Tecmo/Omega-Force integrated the usage of the Personas, is just awesome.\n\nThe story is just awesome. No worries, I won't say ANYTHING about the story. It plays half a year after the story of P5 and  has a lot of moments, where it brings you to almost crying, but it can INSTANTLY change your sad mood into a very happy mood, because of a sudden joke or such little things, which make the story, the characters and their bond just absolutely amazing and wonderful. Speaking of the characters, each of the already known Phantom Thieves and all of the new characters newly introduced to this story are completely well written, each has their own little ''story'' and ''highlight'' in this game - Atlus, you are just amazing in writing characters and stories for your games.\n\nWhat else can I say? I am again cmpletely amazed because of an Atlus-game, which isn't anything special, because, as I've said, Atlus is absolutely A M A Z I N G in writing stories + characters.\n\nEvery city, that you will see is individually designed, nothing looks like the other, the Meta-Verse is truly amazing designed, the bosses all have great designs and I can not stop simping about this game (or Futaba, heh).\n\nI hope for everyone, who will read this, that I could help you a little bit, if you have troubles, buying this game, because you needed a second opinion. <3\n\nOh, two things left....\n1. FUTABA IS WAIFU, FUTABA FOR LAIFU <3\n\n2. ATLUS - PLEASE - PERSONA 5 ROYAL FOR PC AND MAKE AGAIN A SEQUEL FOR THE BEST PHANTOM THIEVES ON THE EARTH!!!!!\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my bad english, couldn't decide, if I should write this review on English or German, so yeah xD",

I don't want to go into full detail on how much I like this game, (because I'm not an anime person) but, all I can say is, that this game is really frickin' great. It has some tense moments, a lot of happy moments, and a lot of heart-pulling moments. I swear I actually cried when the game was over- and considering this was my first game to play in the series, I'm hoping that there will be way more! Great job Atlus. I'll be waiting for the next pc port!",

I was more eager to catch up with my friends and fellow Phantom Thieves: Ann, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba, Haru, Morgana \u2014 even Ryuji. Though only six months had passed for them since we attacked and dethroned god, I hadn\u2019t properly spent time with our ragtag group in three years (barring one weird dancing fever dream).

Lots of fun cutscenes and nice visuals (The usual trippy craziness that Shin Megami Tensei is famous for) really made it enjoyable.\n\nThe only con I see is the real world and choice elements. Most of the time choices are completely pointless since all of them lead to the same result and are utterly meaningless.  Don't expect much from this particular aspect of the game and just focus on the story itself, you'll have more fun by treating it as what it really is, a side-story in the same universe as the original P5.",

        "content": "First of all I want to stress one thing. If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.",

        "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself. So far I am really enjoying myself. I love how it does feel like a sequal to persona 5( Although I wish is was a sequal to Royal.) I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.",

If you liked Persona 5, you'll like this too because it's essentially more P5. Stylish, fun team interactions, great music, a decent story (especially for a spin-off), and just the all-around polish that I've come to expect. My main takeaway from this and the fact that the SMT Nocturne Remaster is coming to Steam (announced yesterday as of writing this) is that Atlus is on PC to stay, and that's what I really love about this. These games coming to PC means that P4G made them realize they can print money by giving games to people on the platform they want, and I'm all for it.",

        "content": "If you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona you enjoy the game. I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything. And frame rate randomly drops. I have a 3090 playing between 1080p and 1440p.",

The soundtrack is incredible, the story felt more impactful and it got me so hooked ever since the 4th jail. The ending was beautiful and the graphics were just stunning at times. It makes me so happy to see how far persona has come and it is by far my favorite game series. This game is worth the 60 dollars completely. I wouldn't even hesitate  to play it again.  I really hope Persona continues to grow as a series and reach more people as it really is special.",

        "content": "A direct sequel to the incredible Persona 5. The main star is an awesome action combat system that is extremely faithful to the trademark Persona JRPG combat mechanics. Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n",

        "content": "Bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam! Okay, now that that obligation is done, here's an actual review.\n\nDisclaimer: At time of writing, this game has weird issues on PC. You should play in either borderless window or windowed mode in general to reduce load times. I had this installed on an SSD and when it ran in full screen it took a solid 30 seconds to a minute to load while in the bordered modes took about 5 seconds. Not to mention if you do play fullscreen you'll frequently get stuck in loading screens. This occurred when playing in windowed for me a few times as well so it's still a toss-up if you lose progress or not. Unfortunately, this happened most frequently after big boss fights for me and was very frustrating. Running in administrator mode seems to help with these issues as well but this game really needs some patches.\n\nStrikers was a surprise. I happened to be finish Royal the day that Strikers released and was eager to return to the world of Persona 5. As much as I find that Musou are not to my taste, this game really hit the right nerve. It tries to adapt the strengths of Persona to a Musou format and achieves this fairly well. It's still a button masher but each character controls differently from one another and being able to swap between 4 party members on the fly is a nice feature. The game is just as stylistic and flashy as the original P5 with a hard-rock twist to the original's already amazing soundtrack.\n\nThe story itself is fairly lighthearted especially compared to P5 and Royal. Strikers is a road trip video game which is something we don't see often and made me immediately fall in love with this tone. The characters are generally having more fun and surprisingly the English voice acting for Strikers might be better than P5 or Royal. Characters feel more expressive and emotive and I laughed a lot more at this game than the previous entry. The story does go towards a direction I didn't like at the end by retreading themes you've seen before but overall, I did enjoy it even if it is entirely unnecessary.\n\nOverall, a fun time and a worthwhile, albeit unnecessary, follow-up to Persona 5. If you can deal with the issues I mentioned and are looking for a charming and lighter return to the Phantom Thieves, this road trip across Japan is a solid recommendation.",

        "content": "Boy howdy, these Musou Games are getting pretty sophisticated. This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.",

That made sure that I saved at every chance that I got. \n\nAnyway I would very much recommend this game.",

The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it. I recommend this game especially if you loved P4G and P5/P5R. \n\nAnd of course, I, like everyone else, look forward to the inevitable Persona 3 and Persona 5 Royal PC port.",

The game is aware of this somewhat, and it does come up as a joke that this is incredibly similar to what the thieves has already experienced.\n\nIf you like Persona 5 in any way, I would strongly recommend this game, just remember to save often as the game tends to crash on me randomly",

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers. Look foreword to it.\n\nI was glad to hang out with these weird kids in japan again, and I was not disappointed.",

        "content": "A fun muso game with a familiar cast and world with the same staples Persona 5 is known for such as it's great sound track and its style is also faithful. Combat is enjoyable and the way combos expand the more you play as each character is a good way to get you playing everyone and seeing each thief's arsenal while in combat. I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less. It is not a great port over onto PC and with these issues being so irregular, be prepared to what you could end up dealing with.",

I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt's getting a negative review from me after 20+ hours because the people who are being fucked over by the constant problems the game has deserve a voice.\n\nThis game has a ton of issues when it runs for many users; I had the issues up until I forced the game to run in Administrator mode, and that literally fixed all of my problems. I haven't had a crash since day 1; on Day 1, I had three crashes. I found the suggestion from a user who had tried making sure the game ran in Administrator and it fixed all of their issues.\n\nI have friends suggesting that the Kyoto boss area is basically unwinnable right now, and it has a crash right after that you can't get past. I'm looking to try and see if that happens to me, as I'm a few in-game days away from that particular date.\n\nThis game is great, the port itself needs some tweaks, but apparently Atlus nor Koei Tecmo plan to do shit about it.\n\nI've lost a lot of respect for Atlus, and now I'm not sure if they deserve any more of my money past this point; Persona 4 Golden was a beautiful port, and it was patched with the majority of its issues solved within days.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks from this game's release and not a fucking word of anything getting changed or improving. Dev's want to sweep this under the rug and get away with it.\n\nIf you can, and you also reviewed this game, swap it to negative and get this game noticed by the Dev's so they do something.",

        "content": "I genuinely really like this game. It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.",

        "content": "This game is amazing!\nA must if you played the original Persona 5 or Royal. While I initially had my doubts and worried this would be just a Musou-kind cash grab, it feels a lot more like Persona 5-2 would be like. The quirky characters, the second to none soundtrack and having a peek at more cities in Japan are all super enjoyable. If you've been to Japan, you'll immediately recognize Kyoto, Osaka, Okinawa and many more locations!\n\nThe battle system can be a bit tricky in the beginning (and very lengthy towards later bosses), but it rewards skills and planning, which is an additional metric to perceive progress in the game.\n\nDuring my playthrough, the game only crashed once. I lost 15 minutes of progress, so make sure you'll save at every opportunity you have just in case.\n\nI only feel sorry that this is a game that can be only fully appreciated by gamers who played Persona 5, it's sad that there is no port available just yet. \n\nDefinitely recommended!",

        "content": "This game is great (I have not beat it, im up to the final \"act\") If you enjoy dynasty warriors combat and love the world of persona 5 then this is the game you didnt know you needed. For those who have not played baseline Persona 5 I would heavily recommend you do so before playing this game. P5S feels great to be back into the world of Persona alone let alone the refreshing combat that gives it a new feel and twist. The characters are the same lovable idiots we grew with through P5 and seeing them again is awesome, added with a few new people and its a fantastic dynamic. If you have played any other persona game you know the music is great and the way they personas work in this new combat feels natural. \n\nPS: Hard mode is really hard at the start and well worth the challenge if your like me and hate yourself\n\nEdit: 45 hours and I finished the game, 9.5/10 I bought it for 75$ and id happily spend that again",

[spoiler] Meaning Kasumi does not exist in this game, Atlus please add her as a DLC later maybe. :) [/spoiler] With a new threat posing the world, the thieves are reunited together to kick some more ass.\n\n[b]Persona 5: Strikers[/b] introduces a new hack-and-slash combat system to give the series a fresh take. As Atlus always delivers, there is also incredible UI transitions, music compositions, and stories to explore in the world. By buying the Deluxe Edition, you will be granted access to the digital interactive artbook, soundtrack, and some behind-the-scenes making of Striker's music- on top of that, you will also receive some bonuses in-game to aid you in your battles.\n\n[spoiler] SPOILER ALERTS: Do NOT peek at the artbook until you're finished with the game, the artbook contains spoilers. The opening cinematic to the game also contains a tiny portion of spoilers, in case you're wondering about that. [/spoiler]\n\nThis game will have you traveling across several cities and towns based in Japan. You will meet new faces, discover hidden treasures, find an abundance of different shops to buy a variety of items from, and clear \"Jails\" (which are pretty much a twisted variation of the old \"Palaces\", you will find out more about them in the game).\n\nAll-in-all, if you are looking to expand your knowledge of the Persona universe, or you just want to beat up a bunch of shadows and bosses, this game is likely for you. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nBelow are my own opinions about the game after clearing through the game and having 100+ hours of experience. Currently on my way to 100%-ing the game's achievements. Whether you agree or disagree to my opinion(s) is all entirely up to you. I have a bias towards the Persona series, but I will try my best to be truthfully honest about this game.\n\n[h2] NEGATIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nWhile this game is overall really good, I can't say this game goes without having a few issues that comes with it straight out of the box. I'll get the negatives out of the way first.\n\n[list]\n[*] My biggest complaint are the random, constant game crashes as well as the infinite loading screens. No matter what you try to do, it seems you can't do anything to fix them. Playing full-screen or windowed-borderless mode causes them more frequently, so I usually play on windowed-mode. You can also try lowering the graphics, but I doubt that'd help. My only tip is to SAVE OFTEN- YOU WILL CRASH. Until they send out a patch to fix these crashes, save often because there is no autosave. I've lost a few hours of progress due to this, the same goes to my friend who's had more crashing issues than me.\n\n[*] Keyboard controls and assisted-aiming feels really clunky. I've played on both keyboard and gamepad, the controls still feel somewhat clunky but once you adjust it should feel fine. The target assistance in the game feels really off, Sometimes I want to ambush a certain enemy, but it ambushes an entirely different enemy. Or even when I want to lock onto a rail to ride on it, I end up doing something completely different.\n\n[*] The anti-aliasing option seems... odd? Not sure how to describe it, but I just left it as it is. Some people might have a problem with it depending on your graphics card.\n\n[*] The DLCs aren't really worth buying separately. You can easily grind the content you get from the DLC. Either buy the Deluxe edition and don't look back, or buy the regular game and play it as it is. Trust me, you'll be fine either way.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] POSITIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nFinally, the positives about the game. There really is a large amount of positives I want to point out from the game, but I'll try to tl;dr it.\n\n[list]\n[*] The storyline is how you expect it to be from a Persona game. You'll be going along for a roller-coaster ride of plot twists, fun and sad moments. You'll easily get attached to some new characters as well. While the gameplay experience isn't as long or sophisticated as the original Persona 5 game, you will still get a nice feeling of satisfaction after clearing the story.\n\n[*] As I mentioned earlier, Atlus feeds us yet another game full of art-beloved UI transitions and new musical compositions. If you love Persona for what it is, you'll love this game. Expect to be jamming to Persona music for a while.\n\n[*] While the battle system has changed into a hack-and-slash style from the original turn-based system, I can say for certain that this is a completely new breath of fresh air. Even by saying it's just a hack-and-slash is not fair to this game, there's much more to it that you'll explore. I actually prefer this over the original combat system. It's just full of constant action and doesn't feel boring at all.\n\n[*] END GAME CONTENT- MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: While there is no clear end-game story, additional content comes in the form of New Game+; essentially you can start a new game with all of your stats carrying over to the new game. You can also opt in to try out Merciless mode, the hardest difficulty of Strikers there is. Once you start Merciless mode, you can't back out. There is also some content you can only unlock in New Game+, so you'll have to play through the game at least twice to unlock all the achievements if you're looking to do that. It feels really nice beating bosses at maximum difficulty.\n\n[*] Each Jail is unique- unlike Palaces from previous games. Every jail you visit will feel fresh, as they're designed to be a new experience from other jails. Each one will have its own atmosphere and aesthetic. Play the game for yourself to find out how different Jails are from Palaces.\n\n[*] You are able to switch between the Phantom Thieves and play as Makoto, Haru, Ann- hell even Morgana. Each thief has their own playstyle. Mix and match your party and find out which strategy works for you! (note: you can't play as Futaba, she's a support character for obvious reasons yet again)\n\n[*] Flashy all-out attacks and showtimes are still present. You will feel like a bad-ass performing these while Last Surprise plays in the background.\n\n[*] PERSONA ON PC!?!?!?!?!? One step closer to Persona becoming the norm for PC gaming.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2] GAME RATINGS [/h2]\n\nControls: 6 / 10 - 7 / 10 if you're on controller\nGameplay: 8.5 / 10\nStoryline: 10 / 10\nMusic: 11 / 10\nWaifus: too powerful to rate\n\nbought the game 3 times for pc + switch, as well for a friend. worth.\n\n[h2] CONCLUSION [/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[i]tl;dr[/i] [b] game good, but please add royal to steam, I have too much free time.[/b]\n\nThat concludes my review of Persona 5: Strikers. Good luck out there, fellow thieves-\n\n\n\n",

However, I cannot recommend it to new players due to the fact it is a continuation of Persona 5's story. If you want this game, I highly recommend you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first before playing this game, although this game is much shorter due to the different gameplay style.\n\nOverall, I recommend this nice game, but perhaps it should add a bit more content in the future.",

        "content": "After eight hours of play I experienced my first crash. This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story. I'll give my final thoughts when I finish.",

I like the way they blended Persona gameplay elements with Dynasty Warriors gameplay, it works really well so you can't just spam attack or just personas. They also encourage you to take your time and try out every party member and not use just Joker as there is no deadlines either.\n\nI 100%ed the game and it took me about 44 hours to do so and I didn't rush through the game either so I'd say that's a good amount if you wanted more Persona 5 content.\n\n",

Given P5 didn't come out on PC however, I'd suggest either playing that first, watching the anime, etc because while the game does try to catch people up a little, most of the story just isn't worth it without that prior experience.\n\nCombat is solid, if at times a little frustrating, but Omega Force adapted their musou styles well here so it doesn't just feel like a licensed skin. Expect shorter fights with enemies that are typically doing more offensive moves.",

        "content": "This game is a must buy for people who have played the original or the Royal version of Persona 5 (or at least in cases have watched a playthrough). The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.",

        "content": "Toughest prison to break out is in your mind\nNow, when I finished it on hard and started my merciless run I can write this rewiew\nMy Exp in Persona games consists of P4G, P5 and P5R\nSo, lets go to the diff, pros and contras\n\nFirst and the most is new combat system. It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends",

        "content": "Even though it a completely a different fighting style than its predecessor, it implements previous mechanics that are very satisfying to pull off. The easier accessability to the shop and depth of possibility in the menu are amazing. As a Persona series fan for years now, this has been worth the wait. the continuation of the story has a very natural progression and feels smooth. \n\nThere is a Lot more voice acting in this compared to the previous and is very satisfying to listen to. It shows that the production for this game is very heartful. Meaning that Atlus believes in their game and decide to put their heart into it's developement. \n\nNow Atlus please put Persona 5 Royal on Steam. I'm sure I speak for a lot of the community about this as well",

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^",

        "content": "I don't believe in unbiased reviews, but I do believe in going into a game unbiased before playing. I can't say I did that with Persona 5 Strikers because I was so dang excited to play this game.\n\nUpon finishing, I'm happy. Some people say this is a good template for future games, but they're wrong. This is a definitive and refined version of a Persona 5 sequel, but it lacks the emotional depth and sense of time that makes the mainline games so compelling and amazing.\n\nBut what Strikes does well is get the gang who you've already enjoyed a 70-110 hour game with, and take you on another adventure with them. This is a game for those of you who maxed the Confidants in Persona 5, spent a year in Tokyo stealing hearts, and decided you want just a little bit more.\n\nI enjoyed the road trip aspect, as it feels like a more grown up theme than a growing up theme - one of my rites of passage into adulthood was travelling with friends, and Strikers captures that perfectly. This is a game that has grown up with people who played Persona 5 a few years back.\n\nWith that in mind, the writing is solid. Sometimes the characters feel like archetypes, but that's par for the course of a Persona sequel. I see it as more akin to the characters being more comfortable in their own skins, openly being parodies of themselves in a lighthearted fashion. It's also not as on the nose as, say, Persona Q was in this regard, so that's a good thing. I went along with it, at least.\n\nMy biggest reservation was that Omega Force were developing it. I hate Musou games, and I won't lie, when this was first announced I felt a pit in my stomach - I asked myself if this would this be a Persona game I skipped. Thankfully, it's more RPG than Musou to its benefit. I still prefer the turn-based combat, and I miss the Confidants/S.Links, but the action RPG combat complements the more streamlined Persona experience in general, giving the game a sense of pace that isn't needed in a mainline release. I'm amazed that they pulled it off, but they did.\n\nAbout the only flaws, for me at least, with Strikers are the bugs. When it works, the game runs like a dream, but there are some visual glitches in All Out Attacks that are jarring, and the amount of times the game crashed or froze was, frankly, unacceptable. I'm hoping Atlus/Omega Force go in and fix these issues, but I can't help but feel it's tainted my experience. My best advice to deal with them is save often and hope the game doesn't crash during a long story segment.\n\nBugs aside, this is a solid game. It's not a groundbreaking title, but it is a solidly made game that sets out to do a thing and does it. If you've played Persona 5 and wanted one more adventure with the Phantom Thieves, this is \u00a355 well spent.",

This game further develops the characters from P5 and brings new ones to the table, which are all pretty well written.\nSo far, the story is pretty decent, nothing stellar, though it's hard for me to judge, not having finished the game yet.\n\nGameplay is a solid mix between Persona 5 elements (Elemental weaknesses, baton pass, all out attacks, and of course personas) and what you'd find in the warriors series of games (basically inane amount of enemies and unique character combos). Some people seem to think this game is a musou. I'd argue that while it borrows a lot from the genre, it is, in fact, mostly just an Action RPG, which is not a bad thing in the end. However, due to the nature of the game, this can easily feel repetitive after a while.\nDifficulty is a bit confusing though. Normal encounters often ends in seconds while bosses can be extremely frustrating at times.\n\nGraphically the game is decent, UIs are stylish as you'd expect from a Persona game, but... the anti-aliasing they use (FXAA) is terrible, and affects the UI, this is pretty bad. I really recommend to disable the game's AA and make use of [url=https://reshade.me/]reshade[/url]'s SMAA instead or, if your PC can handle it, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405510545]supersampling[/url] to make things look good.\n\nThe soundtrack is full of bangers, as you'd also expect from a Persona game. Some of the tracks here are the best Persona 5 and its spin-offs can offer. Play this with good headphones.\n\nNow... Not all is good. Be warned that the game is locked at 60/30 FPS and sometimes randomly crashes when loading cutscenes. Save often.\n\nIf you can handle its little flaws and quirks, then this game is a pretty solid entry in the Persona franchise. And a pretty good game overall.\n\n[h2]If you don't have the time, here's the tl;dr...[/h2]\n* Game is a sequel to Persona 5 and will be much more enjoyable if you played it before.\n* Game is not a musou. It's an Action RPG where encouters are made of massive amount of enemies. The battle system itself is a mix of mechanics you'd find in Persona and Musou games.\n\n+ Story is pretty good and the new characters are great.\n+ Battles are pretty fun.\n+ The soundtrack might contain some of the best tracks in the series.\n\n- The difficulty curve is pretty weird. Normal encounters are easy, bosses are frustrating.\n- Graphically \"decent\". The Anti-Aliasing is terrible.\n- Framerate lock. (60/30 FPS)\n- Game sometimes crashes.\n\n[h3]Obligatory \"Please bring Persona 5 Royal to PC pls\".[/h3]",

        "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "Strikers serves as a good sequel to Persona 5. It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.",

        "content": "I was a bit worried at first that this game wouldn't live up to Persona 5, and well, I shouldn't have been. This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan. (Or just like Mass Destruction)",

        "content": "First of all. [h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well. A definite must have for those who enjoy both persona and musou combat type of games.",

        "content": "*IMPORTANT* \nThis game crashes ALOT, at the worst time possible. I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse. It's up to you to make your own opinion on it.",

I was really happy to see this game out as i am a huge persona fan and have played person 4 golden and persona 5 royal and i was really sad to have beat the game and of the ending being a sorrow goodbye. This game is a lot like persona 5 but with the formatting of Fire emblem warriors or what others have said dynasty warriors. You can use your persona in this game but there is more hand combat rather then only using your persona or automated bullets like in persona 4 and 5. i love that you can also be the other characters and walk around aka yuskue and ana and etc, that is one of my favorite things as i am a huge fan of yusuke and i love being able to explore the jails as him and use him more!  I do really enjoy this game and got it the day it released but i will say there is a ton of glitches going on as the game tends to crash in times where you are unable to save and have to restart again. That can be a real pain in the butt especially when your grinding or in the middle of a movie scene. But i overall really enjoy this game and would recommend it to any persona fan and CAN NOT WAIT FOR PERSONA 6 TO COME OUT! SOLID 9/10.",

I think it's a bit of a shame that it only took Persona 5 as the original and not the Royal version... but that has its reasons. But basically the story is great, the soundtrack is very, very good and the battle system is really better than expected for a musou game. The game runs flawlessly for me and that's why I'm very positive.\n\nAtlus, please treat yourself to Persona 5 Royal for pc!",

        "content": "Spoiler Free!\n\n-Story: This is basically Persona 5-2. The story is a direct continuation of P5, and so if you haven't played the first one, you'll definitely be lost in this game. The writing quality is on par with if not better than the original. \n-Characters: There are some points where the original Phantom Thieves feel exaggerated, but for the most part they're very strong. Not nearly as flanderized as previous Persona spin offs. The new cast members are excellent additions. It's impressive that even with 10-ish characters, no one feels left out of the story. Also Haru got her screen time.\n-Gameplay: The combat is simple enough to get into, but has enough elements to make fights feel like more than just button mashing. Weaknesses, One Mores, Environment attacks, etc. all help keep you thinking about how to attack.\n\nAside from a few nitpicks here and there, I would say this game is excellent. Very fun combat and a great sequel story. The main limiting factor is if you haven't played P5. If you haven't played it, I wouldn't recommend this game. The combat is fun, but it's not enough to sell the game if you're not also interested in the story. Play P5 first so you'll understand these characters and what they're talking about when they mention past events.\n",

        "content": "Strikers is a very welcome surprise. While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a must own for any persona fan. This game not only serves as a great action RPG, but it also has the pressure of being the sequel to the great Persona 5. I'm very happy to say that this game lives up to those expectations. While not nearly as long as Persona 5, the pacing feels natural and fun. Great heart to heart moments fill the space between intense combat and great story telling. This game will take your heart!",

Do not play this unless you have played Persona 5.\nIf you have played Persona 5, I don't think you need me to tell you why I'm recommending a direct story sequel to it.\n\nSlight performance issues with the PC port. The framerate is capped at 60, and game logic is tied to the framerate. There's two modes: 30fps mode and 60fps mode. On 60fps mode with my GTX1060, I can't even maintain 10fps on medium at times, whereas on 30fps mode, I'm comfortably locked at 30fps even on high graphics. It's very bizzare. The default keybinds are not super logical but the kb+m controls are otherwise fine. Generally an okay port overall; definitely playable, if not entirely ideal.",

It was quite hard for me to get introduced to the new mechanics such as abilities, fast forward, ect.\n\nIt's worth mentioning how Atlus actually made a follow up to the P5 story and brings an amazing comeback to the Phantom thieves.

This game often references the past story/game and does not go out of its way to tell you wtf happened in the first game (you should play it tho, it's really good). The combat is much less Dynasty Warriors than anticipated on my part, it's deep and kinda challenging, especially at bosses. It's very story driven, so if long cutscenes bore you, you might aswell skip that game because this game does contain a lot of story only times with no gameplay at all.",

The music slaps, scenery and art style is amazing, and the characters themselves are very funny and interesting.  Yusuke is so extra that I smile every time he talks.  \n\nGameplay wise, the combat is so much fun.  I much prefer this over the fighting style of P4 (and I suppose P5 as well).  I love zooming around jails and jumping on things.  I also like the bonding system that P5S offers, once again, I prefer this over the individual character bonding that was in P4.  \n\nShould you play P5S before playing P5? In my opinion: sure, why not?  You may spoil yourself and not pick up on every reference or joke, but the combat and story is awesome and I highly recommend it.",

        "content": "Well, time to give a review on the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n[b]SPOILER FREE[/b]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nPersona 5 Striker\u2019s story is probably the most disappointing part of the game. Keep in mind that I did not care for the og Persona 5\u2019s story so I had some doubts about this story going in. I thought the story would be bad due to the same reasons I disliked P5\u2019s story, but the things that irked me in this game are different than what irked me in P5. The story is good. It plays with some ideas and themes that work very well. It has emotional moments that work well and the story sets out to do what it wants to do. That is be a summer road trip story around Japan with the Phantom Thieves facing a new threat. My problem is that the story plays it SUPER safe. [b]Spoiler:[/b] [spoiler]It\u2019s almost a repeat of og P5\u2019s story, which is a shame.[/spoiler] It\u2019s also very predictable. If you think to yourself \u201cthis person(s) probably the bad guy,\u201d you\u2019re most likely right. It\u2019s very easy to tell where the story is going. Again, it\u2019s not bad. I still very much enjoyed this story over og P5\u2019s. It just has so much missed potential that completely bums me out. \n\nWhatever the case, you NEED to play og P5 before this as the game 100% assumes you know that game through and through already. Hopefully, they release og P5 or P5R so pc players can play that before this.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nNow, THIS I can get behind. Like many, I had some fears going into this game as I felt this game would be yet another mindless Musou game where you spam attacks and win. And while spamming attacks can get you far pretty early on, it won\u2019t carry you much farther. P5 was half a JRPG and half a social sim. This game is 100% an action RPG. Some will be disappointed by the lack of social sim stuff, but I think the non inclusion of it allows for better pacing in the gameplay, and including it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the type of story and gameplay Strikers is going for. The new BOND system is a simple yet effective alternative to it I believe. The fighting itself lends itself so well to the warriors\u2019 style of combat. Persona elements like weaknesses, technicals, personas, etc mix so well with it. Each character is a joy to control and each one is just different from one other. Each one of them has their own gameplay purpose. The combat is engaging, and constantly asks you to stay on your toes and use the most of your arsenal since not doing so will result in you dying FAST. Try spamming the attack button on bosses or bigger enemies and see how fast you can die. Using weaknesses and technicals as well as knowing what combos to use is key in beating anything in this game.\n\nThe Jails (which are similar to palaces to P5) were all fun to explore and it was joy to see just how creative they could get. Seriously, most of them were fun going through, obtaining loot, doing requests (which are fun and rewarding except the ones where you have to go to an area without getting caught fuck those), and beating shadows was a blast. Some of the beginning Jails are a bit too close in structure for my liking, but the game quickly switches it up, so it\u2019s not a big deal. I do, however, feel that the game got a bit too easy at the end due to just how overpowered spamming weakness and technicals can be at times. I was playing on hard and while it was certainly ballbustingly hard early on due to SP drain, the game got a bit too easy at the end for my liking.  \n\nOther complaints include the lack of gun upgrades. I get the omission of social sim stuff among some other things, but no gun upgrades or customization? Why? That makes no sense since I actually like using guns in this game. Such a weird omission. Furthermore, persona fusing is super basic for seemingly no reason. I don\u2019t understand why they simplified Persona\u2019s robust persona fusing to such a simple state. However, other than the complaints I mentioned, I found the combat overall to be exceptional and constantly engaging. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nThe writing in Strikers is incredible. This game got many laughs out of me and made me feel a lot. However, the writing for the more emotional moments can get a bit too on the nose for my liking, a common problem for Persona, unfortunately. The villain(s) were all fantastic in how they went about their way of doing things instead of the one-dimensional cartoonishly evil villains in P5. They\u2019re all fantastic. However, some backstory for some of the villain(s) gets thrown in your face like 20 seconds before fighting them which felt cheap, even if it was effective. The main characters (Ryuji, Ann, Haru, Futaba, etc) all remain the great characters they are, but they see little growth in the main story. I mean it\u2019s there, but not enough in my opinion.\n\nNow to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, I love the inclusion of Zenkichi and Sophia. Sophia is an adorable muffin that sees an unbelievable amount of growth in the story. It\u2019s to the point where I consider Sophia to be one of my favorites in all of the Persona series. Zenkichi was amazing as well with a lovable personality and real growth, although not to the extent of Sophia. But they both remain absolutely incredible inclusions to the series.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nIt\u2019s Persona. What do you think? Of course, it\u2019s incredible. The remixes of P5 music as well as the original music in Strikers are all fantastic. [i]Counter Strike[/i] and [i]Daredevil[/i] being personal favs.\n\nHowever, the audio mixing could use some work. The characters become REALLY difficult to hear during boss fights especially with the music is blaring. This can be remedied by messing with the audio levels in the in-game settings, but I hate that this is even an issue.\n\n[b]PC PORT[/b]\n\nWhat a disappointment. Firstly, the positives. The game runs at a stable 60fps all the time. I only ever saw frame drops during cutscenes and the velvet room of all places. Other than that, the performance is solid.\n\nNow for the negatives. This game LOVES to crash. It mainly ever crashed for me during fast travel or loading screens. During my 60 hour journey, I crashed a total of 7 times. [b]7!!![/b] Sometimes I would lose upwards of an hour of progress. Do you know how much it sucks to bust your balls on a difficult boss only for the game to crash afterward without saving? Next, the game options are poor. The game is capped at 60fps. I don\u2019t know if this is an engine issue or if the devs were too lazy to uncap it or what. Furthermore, the game still looks poor. Not the style, mind you (P5 style is still present here in all its glory), but the game doesn\u2019t look enhanced at all for PC. Textures can be muddy and the UI quality REAKS. WHY IS IT SO PIXILATED?! Overall, a pretty disappointing port. Also, RIP mods.\n\nEDIT 03/17/2021: New update has been pushed today that [i]seems[/i] to have fixed or at least remedied the constant crashing. So that's cool.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts[/b]\n\nOverall, my expectations were blown away by this game. I was expecting a mindless button masher that would give me some kicks based purely on seeing my favorite characters get back together. It is so much more than that. It\u2019s got its issues, sure. It\u2019s not perfect and some things really drag the game down. However, it does so much right at the same time. This isn\u2019t just a spinoff, it\u2019s the true Persona 5 sequel.",

        "content": "The closest thing we'll get from Persona 5 on PC until Atlus ports the thing itself or (preferably) the Royal remake.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It is basically Persona 5-2, but with a complete change in gameplay. If you enjoyed the original game, this title is a must. I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.",

Persona 3 and 5 are some of my favorite games ever and it kind of baffles my mind how much worse the story and characters are when compared to how they were in original P5 and Royal. The game is fun sometimes, the dialogue is good sometimes, the music is good sometimes. Always just sometimes good. Honestly I remember about 3 or 4 songs from the soundtrack which is baffling to me because if you played the entire 181 tracks from original Persona 5 I could probably name 85%-90% of them. The gameplay is fun... until you hit a certain point and it just gets so insanely stale. You never have to care about fusing cool personas because it's a cakewalk with a single good boss. The characters are shadows of their original personalities. Honestly the only thing this game has over original persona 5 is some better humor. I really don't know why I'm giving this a positive review lol I felt so incredibly numb.",

        "content": "As someone who never really played Musou games, P5S was originally an odd concept but i was willing to give it a shot on account of it being more Persona 5 and a good excuse to spend time with the Phantom Thieves. \n\nI expected it to be a Musou game with a P5 skin but what we have here is a Persona game with Musou mechanics. The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps. No frame loss but i will say that at this time, the game does not support ultra-wide so i get black bars on the side do restrict it to 2560x1440. Not aware of any workaround for that yet.",

I very rarely do serious steam reviews, and i understand it takes a lot for this game to even appeal to you, but if you have played Persona 5 it is a phenomenal sequel in every way, extremely well thought out and thrilling combat, awesome characters and story, and of course a banging soundtrack to boot. It has a couple flaws such as many decisions not having much consequence, some early game resource management problems, and the ending being slightly underwhelming, but overall still amazing. I absolutely love Persona 5 Strikers",

I know that doesn't give me the vet level of experience but i have enough to know this game is good. even though its made by the same people who made dynasty warriors and what not its more of a action rpg like xenoblade. and it still has the same charm of the persona series.",

        "content": "Just rolled credits, and man this was pretty great.\n\nI've never enjoyed a Dynasty Warriors type game, and also felt weird that they were making a canonical sequel to the original. But honestly, this game really really impressed me. It felt like Persona 5 in pretty much every aspect. It didn't feel like a budget title, they really went all out. From what I understand, this is probably the best game Omega Force has put out.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ More time with the main cast\n+ The whole english dub crew being back is great.\n+ The main plot was pretty good. A bit more predictable than P5/R, but still really nice and better than I expected.\n+ The two new characters are great, [Spoiler]Gramps[/spoiler] in particular. \n+ Surprisingly fleshed out city locations that give some of those P5 vibes\n+ Ran really well on my 8700k/2060. 1440p @ 60fps, super sampled quite a bit. After that, it loses that jagged look of the consoles and looks just like the original.\n\nNit-picks (These are all really minor):\n- Persona 5 Royal is non-canon in this sequel, which stinks.\n- It doesn't acknowledge your relationship from the original. (Which I completely understand would be a lot to ask, it just throws my head-canon off a bit when Makoto seems to forget we were dating.)\n- There is one particular achievement to max out all of the BOND skills... which is insanely grindy, and dissuades me from 100%'ing the game. All the other achievements are really fair, but this one is just horrible. \n- You get overpowered rather quickly after the first jail, I never really had to decide which character to spend money on. I could simply just buy everyone the best weapon and armor the moment they became available. \n- You can tell the english dub had to record from their closets at home, so the audio levels are a bit off sometimes. \n\nA couple of spoiler-free tips:\n- Upgrade the Bondmaker skill as soon as it is available.\n- Unlock all the party members Master Arts ASAP. They are fun to use, and don't take much effort to unlock.\n- Make sure you google how to get your game looking nice. The default settings really don't look that good. You don't have to mod, you just need to make a couple changes.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers was exactly what I wanted in an action Persona game. It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events. You can enter and exit dungeons all you want, and the day will still stay the same.",

I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.",

        "content": "It's definitely not going to be the most enjoyment you get out of a persona game, but it's a decent game overall. However, their are a few issues on PC that just are saddening. The Default controls are AWFUL. they're really bad, so I recommend using a controller, or changing them. I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues. I just hope some of this stuff gets patched out, or fixed in some way shape or form, and I want to look forward to some nice ports in the future!",

The review is mostly semantic - Persona stans have already bought it, and if you aren't part of the crew yet this might be a weird place to jump in. For what it's worth, the game is respectful of spoilers to the previous game, and was made before Royal so you're safe there, but you probably want to wait for P5R to get ported to PC before diving in. \n\nAnd Atlus, I'm ready to throw money at a Sophia figure whenever you're ready to make one. I'll mail you a blank check, write down what you think is fair.",

I'm running this game off of an NVME SSD that loads other Triple A games in seconds, but this game legitimately takes minutes to load everytime I see a loading screen. \n\nThis game is also way more difficult to run that it should be. At 2560x1440 on a GTX1080 with a Ryzen 9 3900x, I can not play this game at a locked 60fps even at low settings. For comparison, I am able to play Monster Hunter World at mid-high settings at a locked 60fps at 3440x1440. There's also no uncapped framerate option, no ultrawide support, the rendering resolution scale doesn't do anything for me, there are barely any graphical setting tweaks and overall this port is a mess. But that's just a Koei Techmo game for you. I hope ATLUS will do better going forward because Persona 4 Golden was pretty well done, but that was also a PS Vita remake of a PS2 port.",

        "content": "Game initially was a good homage to Persona 5 but soon became apparent it was not going to follow well in its footsteps. The game starts of strong with a strong opening and good display of the mechanics and gameplay but as you progress through the game you realise it is just a dynasty game. \n\nUnfortunately the game lacks substance. Its all combat oriented but even that is shoddy at best. The story within this game is extremely lack-lustre compared to its predecessors. The amount of actual story in this game is questionable at best. With the removal of confidants and making dialogue scenes more and more scarce there is no actual character development.\n\nThe game is also bugged. Even on a good rig the game still runs slowly and at one point the \ngame would soft lock you from continuing. To remedy this I had to try multiple methods that were convoluted just to progress. The gameplay at times can also feel clunky as its lock on camera and obstacles make it so that you character doesn't move freely or how you want.\n\nOverall the game isn't worth the price tag. Get it on sale. Or just play Royal. It has the content of a side story not a sequel so it is far overpriced. Overall if the bugs were fixed the story is just compelling enough for a P5 fan to want to play but it is not worthy of being a sequel as it lacks the substance Persona 5 had.",

They are spectacularly flashy, great characters and great turn-based combat. This one is different. It is a Warriors/Musou game. This entail huge battles and being overloaded by enemies. I love the combat and I strongly recommend this games to fans of the series or fans of action games.\n\nA caveat to this is that, it's a sequel. The game is 100% enjoyable if its you're first persona game or you've only played persona 4 Golden. It does have major plot spoilers to Persona 5.\n\nA problem that the game suffers from is it is locked at 60FPS. This game would benefit hugely from unlocked frames.\n\nAll in all its a stellar sequel to persona 5 and a great standalone action experience. If you've played persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal it is a must buy.",

        "content": "More Persona 5 is what I need in my life. And Atlus was happy to oblige. And that makes me happy.\n\nThis is probably a horrible place to start of with Persona. Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable. Real shame. But I'm not gonna complain, since things turned out pretty good.",

        "content": "Important note that this is SEQUEL to Persona 5 and should not be your jumping on point for the series. You should play and beat either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this in order to not spoil yourself on characters and events, the game assumes you have beaten that game. \n\nTo sum it up briefly, Strikers takes all the trappings from P5 and mixes in a battle system that feels like an Action-RPG in a musou's trench coat, in which you need to pay attention to weaknesses and strengths of both your team and your enemy. The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n",

Shadows pop up in mob forms, and often mini bosses (strong shadows with health bars up top) come out to play, but hack n slashing won't get you far. You must use strategy to beat most enemies. Run n Gun with joker only got me to the 2nd jail (palace in this game). \n\nOverall it's fun, and aside from getting the deluxe edition to only allow me access to the bonus content on separate disk/download and can't install to my computer.\n\n",

        "content": "If you're already a fan of Persona 5 and you're itching for more, this title is worth your time.\n\nThis title oozes with the same style and poise that Persona 5 has. The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat. Especially since the majority of players of this game are likely Persona vets.",

What I love about Persona was the stories and life-sim aspects, and to a lesser extent the style the series just oozes at all times. Which, unfortunately, Persona 5 Strikers does lack in - there is no real life-sim aspect, and it still has style to it though perhaps not as much as the game it was based off of, but the story is still there and in full force - very enjoyable\n\nI do think that Strikers is quite difficult compared to its mainline entry, but that comes with the territory of an action-based vs. turn-based game. Since I'm not interested, I played on easy, and I still find that Strikers is too difficult for my liking. I know, I know, get good, but again - not my cup of tea, I'm here for the story.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is an intermittent crashing. My first 8 hours or so were fine, but the next few have seen a number of frustrating crashes... I really don't want to have to play parts over and over again, but I find myself needing to. \n\nOverall though, want more Persona? Here you go. Enjoy.",

Enjoyed the game a whole lot as a returning persona fan but a loading bug had prevented me from being able to finish the game. There is no workaround as of right now but the fact alone is pretty unacceptable. Please hop off the bandwagon and actually use your reviews to get this game in an acceptable state. Lesser problems include the fact that the antialiasing is terrible if you're playing on anything short of 1440p and the loading screens were already way too long for what they actually loaded into. Quite sad, hope it gets fixed soon so I can recommend this game again. (FYI if you haven't played persona 5, even when the ridiculous technical issues get solved, don't buy this. Play p5 first, ps4s aren't that expensive if you want to join this bandwagon so badly.)",

BUT as soon as I saw the Koie Tecmo logo followed by Omega Force, I got a sneaking suspicion this was a Dynasty Warriors game. THOUGH, as someone who's only played a handful of these and 3 of their off shoots (including this one), I kind of like this one the best. Yeah, you can button mash, but this and Hyrule Warriors was better at forcing other actions. I've played Persona 5 for a few seconds, but got SUPER bored with how story heavy it is, and how awful the story is, this has a bit too much for me. It's a neat and faithful melding of Persona and the DW formula. Visually this is the best Dynasty Warriors has ever looked. Clear that Sega/Atlus seem to be very protective of this property and were very hands on with it. \n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona then this will definitely scratch that itch. I'll stick around for the battles, and just blow through the story, even though I know from previous attempts of getting into this series (P4 Golden) it means I'll probably get a bad ending, oh well. I'll look up an FAQ if the alternative endings are better or if it prolongs the GAME play. I like it. 3.5 out of 5 for me.",

Having to meet Phantom Thieves again was fun[spoiler] Not meeting Akechi though was a bummer [/spoiler]. And there is a lot of fan service [spoiler] The dialogue when Joker acted as a decoy in the first jail was pretty funny ngl(when Ryuji said is this a deja vu and other dialogue that came before it) [/spoiler] I haven't completed the game yet(only finished the first dungeon) but i would give it a 8/10.

I highly recommend playing Persona 5 Royal before you play this game since Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5. If you go straight into Strikers, you won't understand some parts of the story. Fun beat em up game and great story, but some of the requests are pretty annoying to do. The crashes and FPS drops are somewhat annoying as well, but as long as you download the beta fix from Steam, you will be fine. Overall, I highly recommend this game :D 10/10",

The gameplay is a ton of fun with a lot of personas to mess around with. Music is fantastic as always expected with smt and persona games. Not much could be changed to make this game play better, but on the technical side the game does tend to crash a lot past the first jail, crashing like every 5 loading screens, but that might just be something with my computer. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag, and has a decent amount of replayability, with a ng+ and an extra difficulty.",

If you have been wanting more Persona 5 writing, I would most certainly come to Persona 5 Strikers. While the turn based combat has left the scene, real time hack and slash combat fuses with the beloved Megaten mechanics to create a truly electrifying party. \n\nCoupled with amazing remixes of past P5 songs and the same characters you know and love, Strikers is a game that is hard *not* to recommend. The writing is some of the best ever put in a Megaten game, and there are so many improvements compared to Persona 5, such as UI refreshes, lighting overhauls, superior texture work, and many other additions.\n\nPersona fans and Musou fans will feel very much at home here. I am loving this game, and glad it has come to me in such a low time for the entire world. It is a ray of sunshine in a ever so gloomy and cloudy year.",

In around 18 hours of gameplay it happened 3 times. I lost around 2-3 hours re-doing stuff I already did because my game crashed. It really disrupts the flow of an otherwise really cool story and gameplay. \nThere is no autosave, which was understandable in the original game with its playstyle, but here (in a game where you can get in and out of the jails with no repercussions whatsoever on time management AND get refills for hp and sp for the entire party) is just dumb. \nThe crashes are a big problem that needs to be solved, but it would have been a tad bit better with an autosave function. Again, the game is good, but this is a major problem that needs to be a priority for the development team in a future patch (that needs to come ASAP).",

        "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Persona 5 fan, having played the base game several times and Royal twice. I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100",

The game seems unfinished for steam and not worth your money, Get it on a console and hopefully it'll actually be a finished game\n\nEDIT: after putting in 30 hours the review still stands. The game has randomly closed by itself, and I have still had to alt tab to get keys to work",

        "content": "I absolutely reccommend this game.  It's insane how much this feels like the original Persona 5.  With a few exceptions, the entire game feels exactly like the first game did; menus, dungeons, boss designs...  It's incredible.  I was expecting a musou game more in-line with the others I've played; Hyrule and Fire Emblem Warriors.  Gone are the big battlefields of those games, replaced with small, tighter skirmishes that fit this sort of game better.\n\nThis game would be nearly perfect in my eyes, except for one thing: Denuvo.  Denuvo made my game crash more than a handful of times.  It was a serious drag each time I had to reload and go back sometimes to upwards of an hour.  Sega needs to remove it from the Steam version ASAP.  I had a friend who gave me a launcher without Denuvo, and in those last few hours of gameplay, not only did the game run better and load faster, but it didn't crash once.  \n\nThat aside, if you liked Persona 5, absolutely give this game a shot.  It was the sequel I didn't know I could have.",

The game is a lot more Persona-like than I thought, since it is a \"Warriors\"-type game, which is a nice surprise.\n\nAt the first real free exploration of the first Palace I have only a few complaints.\n\n1) The game crashed on me after about an hours worth of exploration and dialogue.\n2) The game for some reason takes AGES to load when you boot it up. (I kid you not it takes like 2 whole minutes of just loading after you launch it. Weird.)\n\nEDIT; \n\nThe current beta branch (which I am assuming the full patch will launch some time in the coming weeks) has fixed the crashing/hang ups for people. PLUS, if you're like me and were suffering from long loading times either on launch or just in general (even on an SSD) if you set the game to always run as Administrator it helps a lot, not sure why but hey it was worth mentioning if it helps anyone. :)",

        "content": "With most of the negative reviews focusing entirely on the technical issues with the game, I figure I'll complain about the game itself just to shake things up a bit. There will be unmarked spoilers.\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Consider this more of a \"meh\" review. If you just wanna see the gang get back together for a demon-slaying road-trip, are willing to be even more fragile than the Demi-Fiend at the start of Nocturne, and don't mind bosses with insane HP values, it's stylish like Persona 5 always has been and may be worth picking up. YMMV with the story. Also, Futaba makes cute noises when you enter the system menu. This is very important.\n\n[b] Gameplay:[/b] Having tried Normal and Hard difficulty settings, it feels all over the place so far. Both incoming and outgoing damage fluctuates on a per-fight basis between being crushed by a black hole (dying/killing in 2-3 hits) or being slapped by a wet noodle, even when exploiting weaknesses. Taking advantage of persona resistances seems to work, but nothing will save your braindead AI companions from standing in pools of whatever element they're weak to and dying/wasting SP on healing. \n\nIt sucks because the most effective way to take down a boss, assuming you don't want to waste twenty minutes whittling it down while it endlessly spawns additional demons, is to stand still, open the command menu so time freezes, switch to a Persona that can exploit its weaknesses, and spam attacks, maybe switching to another character when you run out of SP. \n\nThis is almost necessary because bosses have an obscene amount of HP, and spamming attacks from the menu deals damage far faster than trying to use the free, reduced-strength spells from combos. It also has the side effect of practically guaranteeing you're not getting hit by anything while trying to pull off said combos, which feels really cheap.\n\n\n[b] Story: [/b] I haven't finished the game yet, but so far the stakes are at an all-time low for the Phantom Thieves. The first target was acceptable since she went out of her way to abuse some innocent people, but the second target in particular had me rolling my eyes; as far as I can tell, his only \"crime\" was not admitting that his novels were hot garbage that only sold well because his editors manipulated him and hyped up his status as the grandson of a famous writer. There was a claim about him plagiarizing, but he wouldn't be the first popular author to do just that and get away with it.\n\nForcing that kid to go on live television and \"confess\" to the heinous crime of being manipulated into writing bad novels had me in stitches. At best, it felt like petty revenge for something that happens all the time IRL in all kinds of media. At worst, it could have no lasting effect; realistically all the company would need to do is throw a few employees under the bus along with the kid in some kind of apology letter, wait a few months, and then the public would forget all about it.\n\nIn short, it's a far cry from changing the hearts of the people from Persona 5. Stopping a teacher from preying on students and driving them to suicide? I'm down, no question. \n\nStopping a famous idol from abusing the people around her? Sure, I guess. \n\nStopping a writer from writing bad novels?\n \n...\n\nWho gives a shit?",

        "content": "I love this game. 10/10 because the writing and the characters were consistent with Persona 5. It literally feels like Persona 5 like all the characters you were friends with going on a road trip across Japan. I didn't think the sequel of Persona 5 would be good, but it turned out amazing af. They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick. Even the soundtracks are as amazing as the OG Persona 5. You know the GAME is good when I played it everyday when I got it, or waiting after doing work and playing it. So far my favorite quarantine game to escape from reality",

P5S continues the story of the original Persona 5 game based on where it's left off but has a twist that none of it's predecessors saw coming. It plays in a Musou fashion where you smack and annihilate enemies in real time combat. It borrows the same concept as Persona 5 where you can use your skills in the midst of combat. Being in constant 60 FPS, the game runs smoothly and feels natural to the touch. The story and voice acting is as superb as usual and it doesn't stray far from the original Persona 5 despite being a different type of game. To Atlus, Don't be afraid to release the other Persona games onto Steam. Many people look forward to it for multiple reasons such as not owning the specified console or in this case, introduces a lot of newcomers into the series. Persona 5 Strikers is definitely a game that's going to do very well so as for other future games that's to come.",

The change in combat is pretty fun imo.  \n\nYou get upgrades in the form of using the Bond skills page, an item shop for better weapons, armor, etc and you still get to fuse Personas and make em stronger as well. \n\nThe new character Sophia is adorable AF and Ryuji gets clowned on some more so that's a plus.\n\nOverall it's basically P5 Lite Edition and I'd say that it works out pretty damn well.",

It never quite reaches the levels of P5/P5R but it's more persona and more of the characters you love however, at this very moment in time I would not recommend it due to constant crashes during cut scenes. So far I've encountered about 10 crashes of the game sometimes taking hours me back multiple hours of progress because of long sections of the game not allowing you to save and or me forgetting. If this is fixed then I'll change this review but until then the crashes are so frustrating at this moment in time it's simply not worth it.",

You also start combat like in Persona 5 rather than have all enemies on the map at all times, so neither battles nor zones are as big or open as warriors titles usually are. If that sounds good then go for it since this is probably one of Koei's best games, but if you were expecting a traditional warriors game you might be disappointed.",

The gameplay is very fun and what makes it even better is the fact that they made each and every character's kit and moveset completely unique on top of the mindblowing soundtrack (which is basically a given in any game in the franchise) and design. I am playing on hard difficulty just because I didn't want to blow through the game in a day and it pretty tough for me, as someone who hasn't really played this genre of game at all. But despite that, I've never once gotten irritated at failing multiple times in a fight, rather I think about what I could do differently until I figure out what works and what doesn't and amidst that, memorizing the movesets of the enemies until I eventually complete the encounter, feeling a sense of accomplishment after several failed attempts. That however is only the tip of the iceberg, it takes some of the core things from vanilla P5 and incorporates it quite smoothly into itself, which in turn makes it feel like a true successor to vanilla. For 60$, I honestly believe that this game is worth every cent. 10/10 would cat van again.",

While you won't have access for particularly amazing personas for a while, I've never really had too many issues regarding battles with the personas you start with. As for the story, from where I'm at, it's amazing. It integrates old characters and obviously includes some new ones.

        "content": "Having finally finished Persona 5 after playing through it for six months, I decided to hop onto Persona 5 Strikers as soon as I finished. I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.",

        "content": "I recommend this game but it is more of a cautionary one.\n\n*Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5. It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)",

I was hoping I would like this hack 'n slash game as I have a tough time enjoying the genre, but this game just isn't for me. The game was also fairly unstable while I played, though I won't say anything more because hopefully the new update fixed it for the persisting / new players.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers The Review\n\nPlayed On: PC (Steam)\nCompleted Date: 3/17/2021\nPlaytime: 72.5 hours\n\nStatus: Completed 100%.  \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not Persona 5 Royal) and follows the same loveable crew on a road trip journey. It uses a new hack and slash action RPG combat inspired in part by Musuo games like Dynasty Warriors but is still ostensibly Persona.\n\nGraphics [80/100]:\nThe graphics of Persona 5 Strikers follows the same style of the main entry using the stylized cel shading graphics. These graphics pop and look great.  They ooze style and feel unique.  Strikers is a bit more colorful compared to the original.  The overall package is fantastic and well thought out.  If you liked the style of Persona 5 or anime in general you will enjoy this as it is more of the same.  \n\nBattle System / Combat / Core Gameplay [92/100]:\nThe battle system in Persona 5 Strikers is a massive departure from the original.  It is no longer a turn based JRPG game but now it is an action based hack and slash that uses the ideas from the Persona world. That said, combat is fantastic and fun. It is both fast paced and strategic as you have to abuse the system, as any good Persona game would have you do, to beat the mini bosses and bosses since they have large health pools. The difference is you have to dodge and move and input commands as you go. When it came down to it I found this all very fun and all of the characters have unique and different play styles that made for a fun and challenging game. The game does abandon most of the outside of combat gameplay from the original game which keeps the game moving steady but you do miss social links for sure.\n\n Audio [75/100]:\nThe voice acting and music is good. Voice acting is top notch and everyone nails it in the English dub. The music is also good but lacks some of the best songs from the original. It still has the feels but with the missing songs it doesn\u2019t quite have the same pizzaz that the original brought. I still enjoyed it.  \n\nControls [71/100]:\nControls are responsive for the most part. There is a slight delay whenever you open a menu that you must wait out prior to doing things but it\u2019s easy to become used to that. All the menus are animated so it\u2019s not bad having to wait a second. Characters can feel a bit loose when running but I got used to it quickly enough.\n\nStory [82/100]:\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers follows after the original game and while this story isn\u2019t quite as good it still brings it. We get extended time with the entire crew as we go on a road trip and this is a great experience and I find that this group fits incredibly well with this format. We begin unraveling the metaverse yet again and from there the story unfolds and the intricacies can be found and present themselves very well.\n\nExtras [60/100]:\nThe side quests (requests) are almost entirely go collect something or go kill something. These can be fun since some of the kill quests are pretty challenging and the rewards are good. There are occasional quests to explore parts of the dungeon without porting or getting spotted and these are different and fun as well.  As a whole though the side quests offer little story or interesting add ons outside of challenge and good rewards. \n\nOverall [87/100]:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a fantastic game that has a combat system that is fun and engaging while being simple and flashy as well. The story is good and interesting and the characters are still as fantastic as ever. If you are a fan of Persona 5 this is a must play. For others as this is a direct sequel I would recommend Persona 5 first then this. If you didn\u2019t like Persona 5 this plays so differently that you may still like it as long as it wasn\u2019t the aesthetics that you didn\u2019t enjoy.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.",

The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series",

It didn't happen to me in the first 10 or so hours, but ever since it's been happening with increasing frequency to the point that it's unplayable now. Tragic.\n\nThere are also other minor issues like DS4 rumble not working, analog inputs being snapped to the cardinal directions, a 60 FPS cap, blurry fonts at 4k, and settings that don't work without a restart (with no indication). \n\nSave yourself the hastle and buy the PS4 version (the Switch version does not run well, but that's a review for another day).",

        "hours": 2363,
        "content": "So... what is Persona 5 Strikers?\n\nShort answer it's Persona 5 the sequel with new flavors mixed in.\n\nBelow are my four key points to hopefully convince everyone who is curious, along with a few other bulletpoints.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are NO SOCIAL LINKS-now, most people would be upset by this, and yes, it is technically a loss for the series as a whole, but it's not quite as big of a deal as you'd might think. You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time. Ideally, this will also give Atlus the incentive they need to release all future (and perhaps previous) SMT titles on PC so I don't have to own a console for the sole purpose of their games.",

Only thing I would say is if you're gonna buy this game on PC, it is best played with a controller. Keyboard and mouse is pretty wonky and while it's playable, the combat is SO MUCH more satisfying on a controller",

        "content": "As of now, I have not finished the game yet, so I can't say anything for the story. I'll admit, however, I'm not expecting anything all too great. Most of the Persona series' spin-offs have been middling at best to outright boring at worst when it comes to any storytelling, so I'm not all too invested on that front.\n\nBut the rest of the game is pretty damn good insofar. The characters are all on-brand, thankfully not being the victims of flanderization. The new main cast members aren't annoying, which is more than I can say for most of the past Persona spin-off casts. \n\nThe actual game-play is much more in-depth than I was ever expecting it to be. Where in past warriors-esque titles you could mindlessly button-mash, you still do that. But in this case, it feels like you have to also employ a sense of strategy to how you approach the game. Then again, it may just be because I am playing on hard mode and your party could very well be dead in just a few hits if you aren't all too careful. If I had any complaints about the combat at all, I don't like how it makes the bosses HP sponges that you just gotta wade through. On hard, that shit is simultaneously highly rewarding whilst also being highly annoying. Rewarding in that you're constantly engaged in the combat and you have to be paying attention to every little detail; annoying in that if you slip up only just a couple of times, that's it. You're done.\n\nMusic and presentation carries over from the original game. I honestly believe it to be the standard to which any self-respecting JRPG should strive for, and that continues on into Strikers. \n\nAll-in-all, I recommend the title to any fans of the series. Or, although I don't recommend going about it this way, if you're not interested in the story and are just looking for a solid tactical action game, then I guess you could play it if you can stomach the anime bullshit along the way.\n\nNow bring Persona 5 to PC Atlus.",

        "content": "[b]Persona 5 Strikers[/b] on the surface may seem like another musou-game spinoff. While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]",

        "content": "First off, I highly recommend this game if you loved Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal.  It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.  I will say that if you have not played the previous Persona 5, then I do not recommend this to be your first game in the series.  The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!",

        "content": "After playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal, This game has not disappointed me one bit. How could they top the original story? Well they did somehow. The wash of nostalgia and references to the previous game was a real roller coaster of emotions. They did it in such a way without spoiling too much for new players while also satisfying a veteran Persona 5 fan. The writing goes deeper to tackle more grey areas of everyday life with clashing philosophies and facts of life which tickle the brain to the open minded person. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself I was a little concerned that it was going to be a mindless hack and slasher without much depth. I've grown fond of the turn based strategy aspect of regular Persona games, but over time I found that the strategy was still there with faster paced decision making. I loved playing all the characters using familiar mechanics in a much more action packed battlefield. It felt really badass linking moves together with your team and landing those cinematic \"Showtime\" Finishers and All-Out Attacks. The music is a banger too. \n\nThe whole experience was wonderful. I can't wait to see what the Phantom Thieves do next !",

As for the game...yeah it's fun if you enjoy hack and slash games like devil may cry, bayonetta etc. Don't expect traditional persona style battles. Other than that this is a pretty solid game, cool story line, beautiful graphics and the return of the phantom thieves. Though 60 bucks for what feels like could be beaten in a week? hmmmm. Even for the hardest of hardcore fans for this franchise..i would wait till it goes on sale",

Persona 5 Strikers has that special feeling that got me hooked on the original and now it's also free of the turn based combat's shackles! Combat, although hectic at times, is never a chore and the story doesn't feel forced at all, everything flows perfectly! BUT if you are looking to play this game without prior experience in the Persona 5 universe i think it might become a bit confusing and little too much to handle, at the opening hours especially. As the game's treated not like a new entry but entirely like a sequel to the original.",

        "content": "Sequels don't work, at least most of the time. Spin-offs are bad, at least as a general rule. And then, along came Persona 5 Strikers, which serves as much of a spin-off as a sequel. It is by no means a perfect game, no game is perfect, but this is goddam near it. Atlus could have re-skinned a warriors game whit Persona, and i would have bought it. Instead, what i got was a love letter to both, the Phantom Thieves and the Players. \n\nThis carries over a great deal of Persona 5. While some elements are shaved due to mechanics, most of them evolved with the gameplay change. Confidants are replaced by a bond system, you generate bond points trough certain requests or by fighting along characters. As expected the buffs from bonds are geared towards action games, more damage, faster bond growth, etc. At the same time this serves as a much friendlier system to the player, while still advances the narrative and deepens the bond between characters with the random personal request.\nAll the over the top action and showtimes are still present, and i must say, they are one of my favorite animations from the game, Atlus really brought out the personality of each Phantom Thieve trough this silly little animations. The combat itself feels fluid and gratifying, if at times a bit repetitive killing random trash. But where the game really shines is trough their boss fights. This has one of my favorite Boss encounters of the saga, and i thought it was nearly impossible to beat Futaba's Palace Boss. It could still use a bit more information on screen, like the direction and the type of incoming attacks from outside the screen, but it is by no means a deal breaker.\n\nThe downside to this game is, if you have not played Persona 5 OG you will probably feel left out on most of the conversations. A lot of references and inside jokes are beautiful winks to veterans of the saga, but might flew over the head of those not familiar with the lore, and i must say, this might lower your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall i will say, give this game a change if you are a fan of Persona 5, if you haven't played Persona 5 yet, i will still recommend buying this one, as it is a very good warriors like game, and despite the random reference you might miss, the game does a very good job at exploring the characters and the narrative is A+ as i have come to expect from Atlus.\n\nPros\n\n++Combat is fluid and rewarding\n++Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\n++4k 60fps\n++Controls are very good and have a variety of schemes\n++More P5 and Phantom Thieves\n++Story Rich as any other Persona/Shin Megami\n\nCons\n\n--Heavy loaded with references and inside jokes (not necessary to enjoy the game, but you do miss some of the enjoyment)\n--No TIa Takemi ( SRSLY NGGS where is ma TIA)\n--Somewhat short (about 40-50ish hours depending on how fast you rush it)\n--No costumes DLC (yes for this game, that is a Con, trust me on this one)\n\nAll in all, if you are a P5 fan this is a 9/10, if you are not, this is easy an 8/10. Buy it now!!",

The time management that P5/P4G had is removed (that can be boring at times).\n\nWith 35:38h in-game, I think that I am close to the end (more 2 bosses probably(?)).\nThe game crashed 4 times in nearly 40h. So save when you can.\n\nBring Persona 5  Royal to PC, I had to play P5 in the RCPS3 :/.\n\n\nEDIT: The final time was about 52h in-game, post-game left (did everything possible before that)",

Very happy to see Persona 5 on the PC in any shape and form, so hopefully we get the the full RPG at some point too. Lots of button mashing and SP potions were required to get through but it was very very enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, it's not without its own technical problems; crashes at random times, with one lot always occurring at a specific point. That seemed to be down to the game not liking more than 16 logical cores being present and once the hyper-threading was turned off, it worked fine. But of course, shouldn't have needed that workaround to enjoy as intended. If Atlas can fix this up, then very much would recommend without breaking a sweat. As it stands, fantastic game, let down by issues you may not know if you will suffer until you try the game on your own HW.",

The game is not bad. This game is a sequel to p5 however, so I'd  watch the p5 animation at the very least before playing this if you don't know the story to P5.",

It's a Persona game first and foremost, but the gameplay within the Jails is pure Musou - even so, the battles are fairly small-scale for a Musou game and, on Hard difficulty, has you actually employ some semblance of strategy as you'll get beaten down if you button mash to victory.\n\nYou still need to pay attention to your Persona's weaknesses and strengths and the best way to use 'em, otherwise you'll just get beaten down and/or the enemy you're fighting will take yonks to beat.  Overall though, this is a grand old time.",

        "content": "For someone that's never played a Persona game in my life, this one is pretty decent. The RPG hack 'n slash feels much better than the turn based gameplay that the others have, which is the only reason I bought and played this. However after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like the fun is over, the story is good to an extent, go and rescue people from being brainwashed, yada yada. But that's the extent of the story and gameplay. \n\nI also feel like the everything revolves around the gameplay rather than story. Up to the third dungeon you are doing the same thing you have been doing for the previous two, maybe it's just me but going and getting [x] but you have to do [y] before being able to do [x] three times over seems monotonous and boring. There's nothing unique that changes in the dungeons that makes those aspects better, it's just the same gameplay loop and I personally got bored of doing the same thing to go onto the same thing again, but in a different area with different enemies. \n\nAs I stated previously with the game feeling like it revolves around doing the same thing to progress the story. It would've been better for me if to progress the story you wouldn't have to do the same thing you did in the last dungeon, but it was a bit different. Instead of go to three bird cages, fight mini boss, which then allows you to fight the actual boss, there could've been other ways to lead up to the final boss fight, such as puzzles, or do some task that isn't in the metaverse that unlocks a path to [x] that helps you get to the boss. \n\nThe gameplay however is good, being able to create persona's, you have bonds/ skill tree, different characters you can play as e.t.c, it's very fun. I enjoyed playing as much as I did, but after doing the same thing for the third time, it just felt repetitive and less engaging because you already knew what you had to do,  you already knew what was going to happen. But hey, maybe that's the whole point. I just didn't enjoy that aspect.\n\n---\n\nAfter being told that the game actually gets good after the third dungeon I decided that I would give the game one last shot and well finish it, I can say for sure that I was not disappointed. Albeit what I said previously and parts of that review still holding up, the game is spectacular. Gameplay does get better after the third dungeon and it is a great story driven game, apart from spending most of it with dialogue, cut-scenes, etc. But that might just be the point of a story game. \n\nSome things I wanted to address though is the frequent random crashes and the inconsistency between cut scenes.\n\nFirstly crashes, this game has crashed *a lot* for me and when I say a lot, I mean hoping for the best the game doesn't crash when you're on the last boss fight, all items used up, 2 team mates down and hoping it doesn't just seize up and tell you \"no\". I say this because it has happened to me at the end of boss fights where you finish a boss off, goes to a white screen, then the game crashes, very infuriating and needs fixing. \n\nSecondly, the cut scenes and dialogue are just inconsistent. I don't know why it's necessary for 3 types of ways to display something happening, you have the first way of just showing it via the just dialogue bars and the characters talking, you either have to progress by clicking or having it automatically do it, then there's it being rendered in the engine and an actual cut scene AND THEN there's it being an actual animation. What. The. F*&k. There are some parts in the game where it will progress in the order and it just doesn't make sense, just show me it in one way! \n\nBut those are just some nit-picks. Great game though and introduction to the series, at least for me.",

But, I was ultimately wrong and this game is nearly identical to the original Persona 5 game. I really enjoyed the gameplay and I enjoy the story so far.

        "content": "This is a great sequel and spin-off of P5, it takes place after the events of P5 and has a completely new combat system. It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

        "content": "When this game was first revealed, I was honestly skeptical if a Persona installment would work with the mechanics of a Musou game. Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

        "content": "Good fusion of action combat an persona style turn based. Works like a charm. Story is not as good as the original persona 5 or persona 5 royal, but it absolutely has it's moments. Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one. Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen). Play P5R, then continue with this for the full experience.",

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way.

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

        "content": "If you liked P5 you're probably going to like this game too.\n\nCombat is simple yet incredibly fun. Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game. I mean. Top rating.",
