        "content": "This is a great sequel and spin-off of P5, it takes place after the events of P5 and has a completely new combat system. It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

        "content": "When this game was first revealed, I was honestly skeptical if a Persona installment would work with the mechanics of a Musou game. Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

        "content": "This game is everything I could ever want from a video game. The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

I was surprised to find that it's barely musou-like at all and is in fact a solid action RPG. Highly recommended for anybody who loved Persona 5.",

I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.",

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game. I mean. Top rating.",

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

        "content": "This is a great sequel and spin-off of P5, it takes place after the events of P5 and has a completely new combat system. It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

        "content": "When this game was first revealed, I was honestly skeptical if a Persona installment would work with the mechanics of a Musou game. Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

        "content": "This game is everything I could ever want from a video game. The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5 (You kinda have to ignore the new additions of P5R, sorry Kasumi!)\nStorywise the game is so good and actually surprised me since I didn't expect a good story at all! \nBut I don't want to talk a single thing about the story even if they won't be considered as spoilers because it's the best if you enter the game blindly! But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one.

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

Not so much.\n\nIf they removed Denuvo this would flip into an instant recommendation. But the shoddy implementation of DRM has made yet another game broken and frustrating to play. Every loading screen you're rolling the dice as to whether or not you're going to crash, and the fact that you can only save at specific spots means you may not be able to recover your progress if it crashes before you can save.",

I and numerous other people have had some fairly frequent and obnoxious bugs. I've had to fight 2 bosses multiple times because the following cutscenes cause me to crash to desktop. I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible. When they patch this game to an acceptable level, I'll completely rewrite this review.",

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game. I mean. Top rating.",

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",
