        "content": "It's Persona 5's sequel - Lite Edition.\n\nThe gameplay is very much like Persona 5's, with a lot of the same. The game is still split in 2 sections, the Metaverse and the  real world. \n\nThe gameplay in the Metaverse is mostly the same as Persona 5's, except for the combat. You'll navigate around, hide in corners and ambushing enemies the same, but instead of turn-based combat it's a Dynasty Warriors style. The fights don't span the entire map like other entries in the genre, but are instead in small, restricted areas. Most of the Persona fight aspects are still there, using Personas to attack, taking advantage of elements, all out attacks, and the like. Ambushes against weaker enemies usually ends up with an immediate All-Out-Attack and winning immediately, though tougher fights do take more time as expected. While fighting, you have 3 teammates with you, which you can control both in fights and while exploring the dungeons. Each teammate has a unique playstyle too.\n\nIn the real world, things are very dialed back compared to the full Persona games. There are no Confidants/Social Links, and most of the confidants from 5 are gone, but not unmentioned. There are no romance options, either. There's no stats to build. There's no time limit on completing the dungeons, you are free to leave and re-enter them as much as you want as opposed to progressing to the next day as is usual. Most of your time in the real world is spent either shopping for items, completing tasks for rewards like new weapons, or just doing story-related tasks such as getting info on the next dungeon boss.\n\nThe story itself I have not completed, but from what I have played it is very enjoyable. The game is very much a sequel to Persona 5, the original version, not Royal. It's nice to come back to the Phantom Thieves.\n\nOverall, while the Metaverse side is quite fun and familiar, the real world side feels lacking and leaves me wanting more. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's still a fun game and the team is as enjoyable as ever, but playing the game makes me want to revisit Persona 5.",

        "content": "A fantastic continuation of the P5 story, though you'll need to have played the original Persona 5 (on PS3) or Royal (on PS4/5) to understand what is going on at all -- as of writing, there's no native PC versions of those games. so maybe hold off on buying this until you find a way to play those.\nStory-wise, the game is more of the same, at least at a glance. Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary. There are still a few optional sidequests that offer little bits and pieces of character development here and there, but for the most part the game is focused on the main story -- that's not to say that no development occurs [i]during[/i] said main story, though: it certainly does, especially for the new characters.\nAlso, Sophie cute.",

Gameplay is fun and new game plus provides a challenge while allowing players to use their personas they built from playthrough 1 (persona series needs more of this). Overall a great addition to the series despite what \"Atlus keeps milking this\" fanboys say. After 60+ hours the verdict is, if you like persona and you like hack and slash, it's a must buy.",

Lots of what Persona usually is (turn based fights, a bunch of stats, timing things, looking up a guide to make sure you can get the best ending) isn't here, and that's totally fine- instead you get a linear story with ONE ENDING with the usual persona kind of stuff, and real-time battles, which persona abilities actually flow rather well into. Instead of confidant bars, you have an overall meter that seems to gain points based on progression and your dialogue options that gives you points to put into whatever effects you want, like increased yen gain, increased item drop, etc.\n\nIt seems fine, but, I was only able to play through the entire first jail before I started getting blackscreens and crashes upon trying to enter the second one. Now it won't even load up, so I can't really judge the whole of it. A fix did get released recently, but, I was actually able to load in before, now I can't even do that.",

        "content": "Kinda late on this since i last purchased but since the game had a patch. I wouldn't know if how much of my criticisms have changed. I think that this game is pretty neat, I wouldn't have had put as many hours as i have put into it if I didn't enjoy it. \n\nParts of the game could have been better, though a lot of my criticisms have been already addressed by a lot of people though I'll say that how leaving the dungeon and coming back to restore hp and more importantly sp is kinda dumb that it just doesn't heal automatically, I guess its to have the feeling of during new game plus or whatever the player can feel like they didn't need to come back and rejuvenate but doesn't really feel like its needed aside from possibly needing to stock up on items which could just be done anyways.\n\nThe story is fine I liked parts of it can't say I'm too much of a fan though even if it is just mostly dumb fun, I like some of the new characters but that's about it. \n\nThe game would crash on me a unusual amount of times for almost no explainable reason, I detected a pattern some of the time with like traveling between the velvet room and back or like leaving the game on in the background for a realllllly long time and then it would crash after some transition back to the real world, but other times i really couldn't explain why like during story events, so I just got used to save somewhat often since it barely takes that much time.\n\nI got a unusual amount of time trying to assemble some heavy hitting personas (even if lucifer is just the best for dealing with large groups) and figuring out a lot of the different combos that come with those personas and even different party members, its all built pretty well. In the case of joker though being able to switch out to a persona that nulls or absorbs a attack was pretty satisfying though it also kinda feels like there's not really a reason not to freeze time to null a attack instead of like dodging or something, due to how most attacks don't really move when you freeze time and select a different persona, aside from some attacks acting during that time but barely ever happens. I think if a sequel or a different SMT spin off as there could be a lot to expand on here gameplay wise. \n\nIf you like this series there's not really a reason to not get the game but just gonna say I'd wait for a discount because despite all the good I don't think its worth 60 bucks, and I especially don't think it was worth 70 bucks even if I got to access it 3 days early and some music dlc/extras which in all honesty ain't much : P (Or you could just buy it anyways). ~~I'm sure I'll complain about the price of things more as soon as nocturne hd comes out~~",

Atlus and Koei really made this game work amazingly, perfectly translating the persona 5 battles into warriors style. The game just as stylish and the writing is just as good, if not better then Royals. All the new music and remixs feel great and unique while still feeling the same. Although the game has some issues running on PC, it still runs well enough to play. The Digital Deluxe in-game DLC I find really adds to the game having the older music from the series' past. Although the Deluxe's bonus content is just a unity project, which means you don't get the soundtrack directly as music files. Atlus actually updating this game on PC to make it more stable is great, just wish they'd fix the optimization issues it has.",

        "hours": 4115,
        "content": "I wasn't convinced about an action-based Persona game, but having completed it, I couldn't have asked for a better spin-off.\n\nThe game previews show Joker facing off against massive swarms of enemies, giving the wrong impression of a musou-like hack-and-slash. Those big brawls are there, but most mob fights are far more similar to a traditional persona confrontation, against a handful (around 10) enemies with different weaknesses, and we could always pause the action by holding down the right bumper, so it's a real-time with pause action game.\n\nEverything takes place within the summer holidays, so Strikers is shorter in both story and character development, but the main cast is as likable as ever. The timeline is a direct continuation from the original P5, but it's somewhat jarring that the other characters seem to have forgotten their relationship (if any) with Joker. Also, considering that the Phantom Thieves are already embedded in the public consciousness and they're stirring up quite a storm this time, it's awkward to not hear a single peep from their outer circle of confidants. The Mishima we know would have gone ballistic from the stuff they're doing this time around.\n\nGameplay-wise, party members mostly reprise their original roles in P5. For example, Skull is still a powerhouse in boss fights; he's actually better than Joker until Joker's personas are fully developed. Mona is still a reliable wind hitter / heal battery, and he can transform into his van form to road rage into enemies again and again. Fox's playstyle centers around countering single physical hits with his own, and a few members can imbue their normal hits with their native element, bypassing physical resistance or immunity. Ammo fully regenerates after every fight. Noir (when mastered) can shoot for free, and certain members have ways to replenish mid-fight.\n\nThis time around, the Personas and fusion system are a bit more interesting. Having come from the original P3 and P4, it was far too easy in P5 (and P4G) to put any skill into any persona, rendering the nuance in inheritance slot limitations, elemental restrictions, and multiple fusions completely moot. I'm pretty sure everyone's glad that random inheritance is gone, but P5's system made it such that personas without unique skills are only as good as their innate resistances or growth potential i.e. the lower their initial level, the better, so many personas that start at high level, e.g. Messiah and many arcana capstones, are no good. It made no sense.\n\nIn this game, there are no personas locked behind DLC, and on top of the 8 skill slots, each persona has up to 3 combo skills that cost no SP or HP. These are innate to each persona, and they restore personas' much-needed identity. For example, want to combo into a free maziodyne? Thor is our only pick. Mara has its own unique combo-only severe fire skill called maralagidyne. Skill cards are still there, but they cannot modify these combo skills, and the best ones only drop at the very end of the post-game of NG+, so if we want good personas earlier on, especially when just going into Risky / Merciless difficulty, fusion is the way to go. There's also no limit on persona stat growth, so if we have the resources, there's no problem enhancing all stats to 99.\n\nDefense passives such as absorb element that are traditionally extremely powerful in turn-based persona, are not very relevant here, because we could just switch to another persona at any time. Enemy moves are clearly telegraphed, and baton pass, showtime, as well as all-out attacks all confer generous iframes, on top of dodge roll. That's before factoring in the omnipotent orb. It's a very interesting change-up in terms of how an end-game persona is supposed to look like.\n\nThere's also surprisingly little grind in this game, which is really welcome. I'm sitting at 100% completion with about 100 hours on my file from just playing through normally, and Joker's personas and four other members are already all maxed out. If you want to max everyone's stats with incenses, that will take a few hours fighting the reaper on Merciless difficulty (he drops 75 incenses in one go). Or if you absolutely need some skill card, e.g. any drain card. For that, good luck, because some of the drop rates are really, really low.\n\nAs for things that could be improved, a persona's combo moves aren't shown in the compendium, so the only way to know is to try them out or look them up. Analog movement is also really iffy even when using a controller; your character is locked into 8 directions of movement. It's bad when moving around, but surprisingly enough, it doesn't get in the way during fights.\n\nAs a separate issue, once Joker's personas get powerful enough, it becomes possible to just endlessly stunlock most bosses by inflicting burn, freeze, or shock, and then literally just doing hassou tobi / vacuum wave over and over with knockdown style and technical adept. That's... a really boring way to play the game, but it's also the fastest way to bring down the boss. That's no good.\n\nThe price of the game is also somewhat high, but dual-language voice acting does not come cheap. The game suffers from stability and freezing issues for many people, myself included. Version 1.02 made it better but it's not gone entirely. I work with software myself, and I get the feeling these problems stem from timing or synchronization issues deeply-seated in the guts of the engine, which was built for the Playstation to begin with. These kinds of bugs aren't easy to fix, but hopefully P-Studio builds up enough experience and telemetry over time to get the persona engine running well enough on PC, so P5R won't suffer from the same problems when it gets released. In this sense, I'm actually glad they released the spin-off first, in order to work out these issues.\n\nHere's to a simultaneous PC release for P6, eh Atlus? Maybe include a difficulty option to disable skill cards for fusion purists.\n\nA few tips for Risky / Merciless difficulty: Start with at least a good persona or two, e.g. Yoshi, and max Navi's HP first, for the defense sections. The best way to spawn treasure demons for money and skill cards is to just move around or change zones when alert level is in the red, after clearing at least one group. They have a distinctive way of scooting around the minimap, and they give off a continuous tinkle even when not in line of sight. In the final dungeon, treasure demons give 750k yen with the money accessory, and you should be able to get one to spawn every 5 minutes or less. Dire shadows are best for bond points. For PP, just keep enhancing and dismissing the same persona over and over.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't miss this if you're a persona fan.",

Start and stop combat with no way to know what's going on, until you're hit with status effects or crazy damage from off screen, baffling decisions such as making you go through three loading screens to heal and sucking all the fun of a Musou / Warriors game out of the formula make this just an absolutely horrible experience to play.\nBut hey, you get about 12 minutes to play the actual core loop before you hit the 2 hours 'played time' limit, so you're stuck with it before you know that.",

It literally feels like Persona 5 like all the characters you were friends with going on a road trip across Japan. I didn't think the sequel of Persona 5 would be good, but it turned out amazing af. They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick. Even the soundtracks are as amazing as the OG Persona 5. You know the GAME is good when I played it everyday when I got it, or waiting after doing work and playing it. So far my favorite quarantine game to escape from reality",

I was hoping I would like this hack 'n slash game as I have a tough time enjoying the genre, but this game just isn't for me.

        "content": "I put around 100+ hours into both P5 and P4G respectively, so I have some amount of experience with this franchise.  In short, this game is fun as hell.  Now for the long part.  The combat is fast paced and has interesting mechanics to boot.  You would think that pausing the game in order to select a skill from a menu would be detrimental to the pace of battle, but it actually isn't. Furthermore, every member of the Phantom Thieves has their own unique playstyle, which kind of implies that each PT member has their own situational usage.  Joker has his usual \"wild card\" sitch, Ryuji is the heavy, Morgana becomes a car, Ann has an enchant, Yusuke is a Fire emblem character, you can finally ride Makoto's bike, Haru is a beyblade, and the two new characters each have their own thing going on too.  Sophia is a great addition to the PT, acting as kind of a Morgana 2.0 from P5, (she navigates the PT to and through the Jails, which are like Palaces from P5, so no Sophia means no game) considering she's an amnesiac who has no clue what her origin is.  However, instead of being quite annoying like our favorite mascot, Sophia ends up being one of the most likable characters in the whole game.  Then there's Zenkichi, who's basically Dojima from P4 [spoiler] but he's a Persona user [/spoiler].  He is also an amazing addition to the PT, acting as a kind of \"team dad,\" who looks out for and genuinely cares about his team, his family, and justice.  The villains in this game are also pretty great.  Instead of being one-dimensional hate sinks like in P5 (not R), these guys have more depth to their actions, usually acting the way they are due to trauma and abuse from earlier points in their lives.  Main bad guy is kind of a toss up though, since I still think Shido had so much going on in P5 that it's really hard to even come close to him, and [spoiler] Konoe [/spoiler] felt less diabolical once you learn his backstory.  Overall, I think this game is great, but I did have some issues with fullscreen and had a few crashes.  Definitely worth the buy!",

        "content": "Overall this game is a little hit or miss. It's got some really good ideas and there was clearly a lot of effort put into this game. However, I believe that the game's pacing was rushed to hit a deadline, leading to the game feeling pretty mediocre and stale after a while.\n\nThis game is supposedly a direct sequel to Persona 5, and the story itself does feel like it, but it completely disregards any of the events of Persona 5 Royal so whether its canon is entirely up in the air. \n\nThis game's rendering engine could also seriously use some AA as the art style looks totally whack. \n\nA decent game but not worth $60 (I paid $70) - 6/10",

        "content": "Little late adding this review as I beat the game/post game a while ago, but opted not to go into Merciless Mode. So just to say upfront: Strikers is fucking great. As someone that played a single Dynasty Warrior game like two decades ago, hated it, and never played another, this was an amazingly fun experience. That said, it's defiantly still a Persona game, which is good. Weakness and Technical attacks are the biggest key to actually getting anything done so it's not just mindlessly spamming the same combo every which way the wind blows. Technical hits in particular are vastly more important then in P5/Royal since you can Ailment bosses and especially trigger Technical hits that will chip away at enemy shields (which is necessary for the few enemies with no Weaknesses).\n\nI would only recommend people interested to hold off if they haven't played P5/Royal since it is a sequel. On that note, the events of Strikers seem to be based off the ending of P5 rather then the true ending of Royal. No mention of Yoshizawa.",

        "content": "I really do hope this game's and P4G's success pushes ATLUS to bring more games to PC.\n\nAside from that, Persona 5 Strikers is fantastic. Fast paced gameplay, all of the Phantom Thieves being playable, amazing visuals and music as always, jails being open world. This game has a lot to offer and, to me, it cuts out a ton of the fat that mainline Persona games have. Practically cutting playtime by half at MAXIMUM. \n\nThis game's main strengths are its gameplay and its bosses. The quick battles and moves you can pull off are really fun. And while the bosses in base P5 were memorable, they didn't have terribly much depth (aside from a few exceptions and Royal). In Strikers, there's a little more to each of the Jail Rulers and I love that. Also, [spoiler]Konoe has the best boss fight and music in the game. I played that fight like four different times. It's amazing.[/spoiler]\n\nI do think the game starts to lose so much steam towards the end (which I think is the inverse problem that P5R had) and the amount of work you need to do to get all the perks is insane. But overall, highly recommend this game to people who loved Persona 5 and the characters, but also don't feel like putting in the insane amount of time into another playthrough.",

        "content": "I enjoyed the game, but it is not without flaws.\nTLDR: The game crashes, save frequently. Combat is fun but some fights can drag on too long. The plot is fine, nothing special but having the gang all together in new places has some great interactions. If you are a fan of the Phantom Thieves and can stomach the potential crashes and gameplay issues, get it. If you aren't invested in the characters, there isn't much reason to get this over other action games.\n\ncrashes - In the 60 hrs it took me to beat the game on normal and do all requests, the game crashed several times during loading screens. There are few things more frustrating than beating a tedious optional boss and then the game crashing when you leave the area.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, each story boss has a unique design and arena that makes their fight interesting. Mini-bosses not so much, they felt more like tedious resource drains. The optional bosses even more so, spamming skills to destroy their guard just to have your fully upgraded all-out-attack move the hp bar 10 pixels doesn't feel great.\n\nUnlike other musou games, melee kinda takes a back seat. The combination of melee doing small chip damage and 100 things flying around the battle, makes melee risky and unrewarding and persona skills far superior. Other than generic grunts, if you are approximately the same level as an enemy they don't especially care about any attacks that aren't the element they are weak against. Each character has a combo or 2 that deal their element as damage without using sp, but the real deal hits harder. You're gonna want to stock up on sp recovery for challenging fights.\n\nThere are some fun character interactions as the thieves interact with each other in new situations and environments. I also love the new characters. There is nothing from royal since the games were being made at the same time, so don't expect 3rd semester character growth to be present here.",

This game has all the complexity in mechanics and gameplay of the mainline series squished uncomfortably into a far more fast paced game.  You must still juggle multiple persona types and hit weaknesses while making sure to not deplete your SP, but now with the added annoyance of large scale battles where you must also weave and dodge attacks.  Too many times I've lost fights because my team didn't have the correct type matchups, or we burned through all our SP in a single strong enemy encounter.  These are fine in a 100+ hour turn-based RPG, but it feels VERY out of place in a Dynasty Warriors-style hack n slash.  \n\nI loved Persona 5 and there are times when I love Strikers, but it's far too complex to enjoy consistently for me.",

Might have been because I played a bit not connected to the internet.)\n\nNo confidants so no romancing, but on the plus side, you can choose the funny answers without any worries!\nThis game does crash a lot, unfortunately. While not a perfect fix, I found changing the settings to not be fullscreen and the ratio to be 1.0 to help a lot.

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

Good thing the battles are crazy fun, swapping from a turn based to open world combat system is one of the best changes to the persona formula imo. The personas are all unique as well despite joker being the only one to wield multiple. The new characters, villains, dialogue, features, and boss fights all make for a wonderful experience. Atlas has outdone themselves yet again, give the game a try if you have $60 to spare!",

You can use any controller you can connect to Steam for this game but you need to launch the game with the controller already in use on the PC. I recommend launching the game from \"Big Picture\" mode. \n\nOne major issue (at the time of this review 4/13/21) is a crashing issue. My game has crashed when entering Jails (this game's version of a Palace) and during transition sequences within the Jails. So i HIGHLY recommend saving at EVERY possible chance you get or you will lose progress when it crashes.\n\nMusic is great, just like in every other Persona game. \n\nGameplay is obviously different but once you get used to it you will enjoy it, especially if you like games like Dynasty Warriors. Being able to play as any character in your party is a nice touch and having (almost) every beloved Phantom Thief unlocked right away is a good touch. Joker's Wild Card still lets you get Personas, but now instead of convincing them to join you they will instead sometimes drop masks when defeated. Fusion is more or less the same with some new mechanics that are easy to understand.\n\nSophia is new best girl?",

Not that the turn-based is bad, just that this system is just a lot more fun.\n-Standard Persona stuff, honestly do not get this game if you've never played persona 5. \n\nCons\n-Even though the combat is fun, it's repetitive. After awhile, you can't even enjoy the music since you are way too powerful for the normal minions, Even on hard. Go in, all-out-attack and repeat. The mini-bosses are fun and should be integrated more and much more often. \n\n-In my 60 hour gameplay, I crashed 5 times. That's not really game breaking but a bit annoying. And it's random too. My pc specs is above average ( ryzen 7 3700x & RTX 3080 ). Your mileage might differ, but 5 times in 60 hrs is kinda annoying since there is no autosave. \n-Why release the sequel on multiple platforms and not the original? really weird decision making.\n\nConclusion\n-For persona 5 players : instant buy\n-normal people : play persona 5 first\n-for people who hate weeb stuff : hell no",

        "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5. The world needs more Persona games.",

Where is my girlfriend and what have you done with her?\n\nI\u2019ll admit, Hifumi wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind when I first returned to the world of turn-based Japanese roleplaying game Persona 5. I was more eager to catch up with my friends and fellow Phantom Thieves: Ann, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba, Haru, Morgana \u2014 even Ryuji. Though only six months had passed for them since we attacked and dethroned god, I hadn\u2019t properly spent time with our ragtag group in three years (barring one weird dancing fever dream). I was curious to see what they\u2019d gotten up to in my absence, and how our experiences together might have impacted them.",

        "content": "[edited for clarity and I have played for longer for a more fair review]\n\nWho is this game for and whether to get it or not:\n> Would both recommend and not recommend. \n` If you haven't played Persona before (I presume you're a PC gamer)-- get P4 Golden through Steam ($20) to see the designs and game play (turn based, social links, etc). \n` If you dislike/like the game play or even the outdated bland everyday core character designs, this may or may not be a good Persona game for you. \n` Persona main line games are turn and romance based while this is action and kill-em-all genre needing a controller. \n` Don't buy simply because it's Persona.\n` If you buy-- get it on Sale b/c full price expensive considering it's different from its mainline game \n\nMy experience with the Persona franchise and Atlus: \n> I have played P4 Golden so I have high expectations for this game (PC gamer so through Steam, not console besides 3DS or Wii). I also have labyrinth Q2 on the way. My previous \nAtlus games are Persona 4 Golden, EOU, and if it counts-- BlazBlue Cross Tag because Arc System Works brought in P4 Arena(?) characters [it's a mess, don't recommend it].\n\nTL/DR: \n> Good game play-- needs controller (recommend Xbox Spectra). \n` Kill-them-all style. \n` P5/Strikers needs a DLC to update the character designs as they are average/bad (forgot to mention i'm mostly focusing on their everyday clothes and hair, and MEH voice actors especially for the average English dub cast even though they casted excellent ones in the past) \n' reminiscent of the era Persona 4 took place in (2008/2012) years before even though the fashion in 2016-2021 (time of P5 releases) is a huge glow up-- Atlus didn't bother updating hair or modernize the fashion which is disappointing. \n~ If you get this, only get it for the hack and slash game play-- OST is nice so the DLCs are up to you.\n\nLikes:\n> I love the smooth game play, good models (as in construction and this includes area layouts/buildings), and it's cool how they show character cut scenes when they talk and something important/dramatic comes up. Love the camera angles. I just finished the Alice arc and thought her castle had a simple get good design (not too cluttered and overbearing, it fit Alice nicely to contrast her appearance to the general public)\n\n> Kill-them-all style,, less romance focus\n\n> Fresh breath from turn based and a dancing game (not like turn based is bad, nor is dancing), this game is a great example of this action genre.\n\n> This is optimal with a controller. I use an Xbox Spectra controller (also recommend Xbox made controllers for Windows cuz Microsoft owns Xbox Live/Network's service and it's just that association? No need for pricey $200 controller, you broke college student.). It is affordable and smooth/good for $40.\n\nDislikes (will possibly trigger the closed minded, weeaboos, P5 character simps, those who cannot take criticsm of a favorite company, etc.):\n> It still crashes,, was mad it crashed at the metaverse school boss\n\nThe juicy bits-- don't @ or harass me\n\n--- Talking about previous Atlus games I played ---\n> My experience with Atlus is memorable. EOU was unique and the designs reflected the characters really well, including voice actors and classes & personality. The classes of characters reflected on their design while being stylized. \n` P4 Golden has a generic core cast but all are so different and unique, and relevant for 2008/2012 where the fashion and character tropes represented media at the time. Memorable game and had great characters/designs.\n\n--- Now for the tea (?),, my siblings (non Persona players) watched me play this game and felt the same about many of the designs,, others I'm nitpicking especially when they had/have the chance to improve the series ---\n\nA little P5 criticism before Strikers:\n> P5 designs were still in the 2008/2012 era despite being released in 2016. They had an alright character basis but 2016 had amazing fashion trends especially with the popularity of Asian music groups. Instead, P5 is outdated with tropes/designs that either 1) outdated or taken from older games & already done (Ann is a knockoff of Rise,, a different troupe should've been done) or 2) appeal to the audience that wants fan service like a gamer girl who doesn't look like one (there's NSFW stuff on the internet about underage Persona girls because Atlus designers gave fan service material-- 20 is the age in Japan where people are considered adults). I get that this is fantasy and not real but like really? Stop fantasizing about underage girls and guys (in sexual ways, if you like their character and/or style, that's different). Graphics and art were nice though. \n\nP5 Strikers:\n> Uncomfortable scenes (this is subjective)\n\n> Phones confirmed to be early age of smart phones yet advanced (Ramen scene before cast left Shibuya,, you showed Sophia what a giant ramen bowl looks like with flipping your phone to show using the front screen [kinda creepy she can use you camera when she wants-- she's the FBI] and Sophia in general is able to detect jails with her nose meaning phones have 4D capabilities to smell)\n\n> still kept the designs of P5 which could be fixed/updated with a DLC release. It is implied the team hasn't met up much during the summer and lots of changes happen in a few months when no school restrictions. P4 Golden showed the cast in Summer if you got the good ending and how everyone's hair/clothes changed.\n\n> Designs still 2008/early 2010s era or straight up bad/wtf moments. Give Haru bangs & modern curly asymmetrical bob (she's a 5 head...) and redesign Sophia to look like a cool robot (hell, Pixel and Zane from freakin' Ninjago has a better design to reflect the fact they aren't human). \n` Strikers doesn't focus on flirting as there isn't social bonds (deal breaker for some and others not). Instead, you focus on action just like in mainstream Persona and has a kill-them-all style. \n\nGet this on sale-- full price isn't worth it. Bf got this for me though.",

        "content": "A great sequel to Persona 5, and one of the best games the musou subgenre has to offer. P5\u2019s stylish and bold aesthetic perfectly mixes well with the musou genre. The Phantom Thieves\u2019 attacks are consistent to their original kit and are fluid. The new showtime attacks look awesome and are satisfying to use when facing a large enemy mob. Persona skills are still available and give you some time to breath during a battle, maintaining some of the turn-based mechanics from the original game. I feel more encouraged to switch between party members in this game since all of them have much higher utility in this game compared to the original game, where I would have a set party for a majority of the game. The persona elements help make the game feel less repetitive in combat since there\u2019s plenty of combos, abilities, and party members to try and use, which is a problem that plagues games in this subgenre.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves finally get some quality time together as they traverse across Japan to, which was much needed in the original game (looking at you Haru). There are plenty of moments during this road trip for fans of the game to enjoy. Zenkichi and Sophia are awesome additions to the main cast and have some of the most compelling character arcs in Persona 5. Villains in this game are more sympathetic than their P5 counterparts since most villains in Strikers were originally well-intentioned people before being twisted due to certain events. It\u2019s a welcome change.\nThe lack of social links is disappointing. Confidant abilities get replaced with bond skills that are useful, but very grindy to accumulate the points to maximize the skills without the dynamic building between Joker and the confidant. Most of the cast from P5 are nowhere to be referenced, which kinda sucks. I would\u2019ve at least liked the cast to mention how some of the side characters were spending their time in this game as a fan, but it\u2019s ultimately a neutral exclusion.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a game I\u2019d highly recommend to people who played Persona 5/Royal. Fans would enjoy seeing the Phantom thieves enjoy their quasi-summer vacation and more moments from their favorite members. Would I recommend it to people who have not played Persona 5 or Royal? Probably not since it\u2019s a direct sequel, but gameplay wise, it\u2019s one of the best musou games for sure.",

The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat.\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.",

        "content": "I find myself very in between on this game I love Persona 4 & 5, the story and game play are fantastic, I also love the fast pace of Koei-Tecmo's Samurai/Dynasty warrior games. With that being said this game should totally be up my ally right. Well long story short I enjoyed the story, the game play was just OK. A lot of the time It was hard to follow what is going on in fights and the difficulty spike on the first mini boss was jarring. I think again story wise the game is pretty good more time with the phantoms thieves and overall comes to a satisfying conclusion. The game play is the weak point for me, I also wish the hub cities were bigger/had more to do, with all that the game is worth getting for story alone and the overall environments the jails present are visually really cool, but again I had trouble with the fighting/abilities or really investing in any of the other characters abilities( played joker pretty much exclusively) *spoiler really sucks if you haven't done this by the end of the game*. recommend for story but game play is hard to get into that's just my opinion. Story also felt a little long by the end of it and this is from someone who has played Yakuza: like a dragon, Persona 4 & Persona 5.",

Significant character growth was literally non-existent.\n- Copious frame rate drops during jails; could just be my specs but HOT DAMN did they bust my ass.\n\nVerdict: If you're looking for fluid gameplay or just love Persona, you're in for a treat.

It\u00b4s more time with the phantom thieves and their members, which is great. Sure, you dont have to manage school-life or your confidances, and battles are fought in real time, but it still FEELS all Persona 5-ey. If you played the original (or Royal) you know what I mean, the style, the music and the whole atmosphere.\nIt\u00b4s just a bit different, but I would like to stress that that\u00b4s not a bad thing. You just feel a different kind of rush and excitement when you have to control the movements of the thieves directly in battle, The change in genre fits surprisingly well (at least for me)! Before you had all these thievy characters in a rather static battle-system, this one allows you to experience much better how the phantom thieves sneak around enemies or weave through them, and it feels awesome.\n\nSo yeah, watch Queen screaming FIST OF JUSTICE while the new Last Surprise track is blasting and try to tell me you dont love this. \n\n10/10, more \"For reals\"s from Ryuji\n11/10 Ryuji drops the f-bomb finally",

Another gripe I have is with the level design. It just comes off as not professional. At one point there is a puzzle that was so easy I laughed. The writing for the characters has lowered in quality from the first. Everyone's words just feel hollow. My main source of fun in P5S was in persona fusions and actual fighting. The rest just made me want to replay Persona 5",

        "content": "After completing everything this game has (Merciless Mastered), it's a really great and even if you're trying persona 5 for the first time, you could hop in and have a great time with the characters. Though of course, HIGHLY recommend that you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before entering here as you'll get to be more attached to the characters beforehand.\n\nI've never really played any kind of game like this in the past so I started on normal and that was already a good enough challenge personally. So don't worry about starting on normal if you're not looking for a challenge, that's why there's a merciless mode for those who want to challenge themselves. I think starting on hard mode is also a good enough challenge for those starting out. \nI think the gameplay is near perfect for those who want to either take it back and just play casually and those who really want to challenge themselves. The mechanics are simple but if you want to be able to maximise your output you have to be strategic with quite a lot of things. Combo's with normal attacks, combo's into your persona, and evading your enemy, while you can button mash, you'll get punished for not knowing what you do in hard boss fights and especially on merciless mode. Merciless will destroy you if you aren't being conscious of what you're doing in terms of attacks and spacial awareness, if you get caught by an enemy you'll most likely be dead, your entire party included.\nStarting on normal and then switching to hard later on I feel is the best thing to do. Normal will teach you the main mechanics well while hard will challenge you on using those mechanics to the best of your abilities. Merciless will challenge everything you have mechanics and resource wise. \n\nWhile the story isn't too heavy handed in terms of twists and complexity, it's a very enjoyable one with barely any bad moments. The dynamics between the characters are honestly written very well and they really do feel like a band of merry friends at the end of the day. And the new characters are amazing too, they're a very nice addition to the group.\nMusic is top notch, seriously, I don't have a single song I hate in this game. From city vibing, to the many and various battle themes, there's so much to enjoy.\nAnd I do love me some boss fights. I really do like all of them. While some have some annoying mechanics, they aren't frustrating to deal with.\n\nIf you've seen other reviews, then you've seen that this game has a complaint of crashing. And yes it does, I had quite a few in the beginning but I kind of learned a trick that could help others if you're having the issue as well.\nDuring transition screens whether that's areas, the metaverse, or after boss battles, that's where the game usually crashes (at least for me). Don't furiously click or press any keys during these transitions. Rapid clicks or pressing of the keyboard have caused like, 99% of my crashes so while it may be different for others, those with the issues may find that this will help and hopefully it does.\n\nBut yeah, it's an amazing game. I hope this review helps in some type of way as I felt it was necessary after getting all the achievements possible in this game.",

        "content": "Quick heads up before you play this game,\nThis game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 and you will be lost playing this without understanding the story of Persona 5. Although the developments from Persona 5 Royal are kinda disregarded here, I'd recommend playing that instead of base P5, if not for the improvements on the base game then purely for the Third Semester.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a hefty addition spanning (in my case) 50 hours long. A third of P5R and half of P5. The combat here heavily resembles that of dynasty warriors, in which you have to fight off hordes of opponents in real time with 3 more phantom thieves by your side. The story here is kind of weak compared to P5R, but still really enjoyable and fulfilling besides. If you have played P5 or P5R, I'd highly recommend this game as despite the main 8 thieves not getting much character development (as they already got all of it from their confidants in P5), it is still nice seeing them ebb and flow off each other and the two new main characters.\n\nTime to go on a trip with P5S and steal back some desires.",

Lots of fun cutscenes and nice visuals (The usual trippy craziness that Shin Megami Tensei is famous for) really made it enjoyable.\n\nThe only con I see is the real world and choice elements. Most of the time choices are completely pointless since all of them lead to the same result and are utterly meaningless.  Don't expect much from this particular aspect of the game and just focus on the story itself, you'll have more fun by treating it as what it really is, a side-story in the same universe as the original P5.",

The jails don't feel like Warriors battlefields, they feel like dungeons. Not saying that's inherently bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. The writing isn't amazing, in fact they somehow managed to make the characters feel even more one note than they did in the first game. But persona spin offs are always like that, let's be real all of us were going into this expecting that. If I could give this a neutral rating I would. Overall I'd say it's good but probably worth waiting for it to go on sale. I don't think it's with a full 60 bucks.",

Very happy to see Persona 5 on the PC in any shape and form, so hopefully we get the the full RPG at some point too. Lots of button mashing and SP potions were required to get through but it was very very enjoyable.\n\nThat being said, it's not without its own technical problems; crashes at random times, with one lot always occurring at a specific point. That seemed to be down to the game not liking more than 16 logical cores being present and once the hyper-threading was turned off, it worked fine. But of course, shouldn't have needed that workaround to enjoy as intended. If Atlas can fix this up, then very much would recommend without breaking a sweat. As it stands, fantastic game, let down by issues you may not know if you will suffer until you try the game on your own HW.",

The gameplay is smooth and tight, the combat is fun.\n\nThe open combat style actually fits surprisingly well with the Persona roster of abilities and demons.

        "content": "First of all I want to stress one thing. If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.",

        "content": "Having played and 100% Persona 5 originally, I was quite excited to get back into the world of Persona 5. The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. Coming up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid. Regardless, if you played the original Persona 5/Royal and have missed the Phantom Thieves, then this is definitely that game to scratch that itch.",

        "content": "i have not finished the game yet, i am on one of the final dungeons*\n\ntl;dr, 8/10 get it if you like the persona franchise, theres a good amount of things wrong with it, and it did feel somewhat disappointing in its overall design, but at the end of the day its enjoyable.\n\nP5S does a lot of things good, a lot of things bad, but mostly its just alright.\nthe story isnt bad, but is not unique and feels like a watered down version of the original game. i can't exactly go into specifics as i would consider it spoilers so i will have to leave it at that.\n\nthe gameplay is surprisingly fun and the rpg elements of the original games are adapted incredibly well into the musou/warriors genre, but theres definetly a bizzare imbalace.\nunlike the original game there is no calender system, which is fine, although it means you can enter and exit a palace as much as you want with no penatly, meaning that hp and sp are mostly meaningless as if you feel like it, you can just leave and refill all your stats which can make the game too easy and somewhat boring. theres also the issue of that i personally struggled with the teammates ai, it felt like any magic damage focused characters & support characters were constantly using their skills when i never wanted them to, making it so that they have little sp when i do want to use them.\nthese are mostly just minor complaints though, at the end of the day the gameplay is fun and allows for a surprising lot of variety in how you choose to play, and thats what matters.\n\nthe \"jails\" (essentially what are supposed to be just palaces) are easily the worst aspect of this game. being a spinoff game of persona 5 i was severely dissapointed by the dungeons and general stylization of this game.\nnearly all of the jails follow an incredibly boring and repetitive formula. the jails all play the exact same which simply is not fun to go through, especially coming from p5 which was the first game in the series to have actually designed dungeons, i had to say i expected more of the design for the jails, you could essentially reuse the same jail over and over and other than the visuals i would not be able to tell a difference.\n\nrelating to the visuals, they are definitely lacking in this game. most of the jails designs feel INCREDIBLY unoriginal and bland i dont exactly want to be more specific, as i would personally consider singling out a few jails as spoilers, but most of them just feel like a city but with incredibly generic fantasy designs.\n\nthe music is also somewhat of a letdown. p5s is very inconsistent in its soundtrack, it definitely has a good number of songs that sound like they'd come from p5 but for as many one of the songs that sound faithful to its original, there are just as many songs that sound like generic uninspired video game music which is horribly disappointing. the generic sounding videogame music is still well made, its just very disappointing coming from the persona series which is well known for its amazing soundtracks.\n\noverall its a game that you can enjoy if you're a fan of the persona series, but is still disappointing when compared to its source material.",

        "content": "Just rolled credits, and man this was pretty great.\n\nI've never enjoyed a Dynasty Warriors type game, and also felt weird that they were making a canonical sequel to the original. But honestly, this game really really impressed me. It felt like Persona 5 in pretty much every aspect. It didn't feel like a budget title, they really went all out. From what I understand, this is probably the best game Omega Force has put out.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ More time with the main cast\n+ The whole english dub crew being back is great.\n+ The main plot was pretty good. A bit more predictable than P5/R, but still really nice and better than I expected.\n+ The two new characters are great, [Spoiler]Gramps[/spoiler] in particular. \n+ Surprisingly fleshed out city locations that give some of those P5 vibes\n+ Ran really well on my 8700k/2060. 1440p @ 60fps, super sampled quite a bit. After that, it loses that jagged look of the consoles and looks just like the original.\n\nNit-picks (These are all really minor):\n- Persona 5 Royal is non-canon in this sequel, which stinks.\n- It doesn't acknowledge your relationship from the original. (Which I completely understand would be a lot to ask, it just throws my head-canon off a bit when Makoto seems to forget we were dating.)\n- There is one particular achievement to max out all of the BOND skills... which is insanely grindy, and dissuades me from 100%'ing the game. All the other achievements are really fair, but this one is just horrible. \n- You get overpowered rather quickly after the first jail, I never really had to decide which character to spend money on. I could simply just buy everyone the best weapon and armor the moment they became available. \n- You can tell the english dub had to record from their closets at home, so the audio levels are a bit off sometimes. \n\nA couple of spoiler-free tips:\n- Upgrade the Bondmaker skill as soon as it is available.\n- Unlock all the party members Master Arts ASAP. They are fun to use, and don't take much effort to unlock.\n- Make sure you google how to get your game looking nice. The default settings really don't look that good. You don't have to mod, you just need to make a couple changes.",

        "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.",

And sometimes the story advances while you are in combat and it's easy to lose what is happening in the top corner of the screen with all that chaos happening on the battlefield. \n\nIt is way more than a Musou game with a Persona coat of paint, it is a Persona game with a different combat system. \n\nI think you could play this without having played P5, but you would en enjoy it more if you did. Kinda weird to have the sequel available on Steam but not the first... Where's Persona 5 Royal on PC ? Atlus ? Sega ? I'll buy it in a heartbeat. Also Persona 3 FES, I'll buy it all, gimme please.",

What I love about Persona was the stories and life-sim aspects, and to a lesser extent the style the series just oozes at all times. Which, unfortunately, Persona 5 Strikers does lack in - there is no real life-sim aspect, and it still has style to it though perhaps not as much as the game it was based off of, but the story is still there and in full force - very enjoyable\n\nI do think that Strikers is quite difficult compared to its mainline entry, but that comes with the territory of an action-based vs. turn-based game. Since I'm not interested, I played on easy, and I still find that Strikers is too difficult for my liking. I know, I know, get good, but again - not my cup of tea, I'm here for the story.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is an intermittent crashing. My first 8 hours or so were fine, but the next few have seen a number of frustrating crashes... I really don't want to have to play parts over and over again, but I find myself needing to. \n\nOverall though, want more Persona? Here you go. Enjoy.",

I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.",

        "content": "Don't buy this game if you haven't played through the original Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal) which sadly isn't available on PC (legally at least...). If you did this game is much more than just a musou and I definitely recommend it.\n\nWhile it doesn't have social links and the calendar system this game is pretty much a sequel to Persona 5.\n\nAlmost all the elements from the original turn-based combat system are also present in the new real time combat of Strikers even if they work a bit differently. Affinities, skills, Persona fusion (obviously not to the same extent), the dungeon crawling; it's all there and it's fun!\n\nThe story doesn't only take place in Shibuya this time, it's a roadtrip across Japan and the changing scenery/locations constantly keep things interesting. The new characters are great, the music is fantastic as always. All the characters play differently with their own unique mechanics and due to the affinity system you need to pick the right party and persona loadout for Joker for the right bosses/encounters.\n\nThe story is decent, it starts out very solid but unfortunately runs out of steam close to the end. The pacing is all over the place. The last boss is [spoiler]pretty much the same as the one from vanilla Persona 5 (literally the same being if you know a bit about gnosticism...)[/spoiler], so I wasn't really paying much attention at the end anymore, it just felt like a repeat and the phantom thieves were saying very similar lines that didn't have much of an impact anymore.\n\nThe combat can get very tedious especially in the late game. Even on Normal difficulty some bosses and shadows will have very high HP pools while your party members can die in 2-3 hits. You spend alot of time just whittling away at their life until you manage to knock them down for an all out attack which maybe does like 10% of their HP. I understand they wanted the combat to be more strategic and focused on exploiting enemy weaknesses but at some point it just stops being fun. Especially when the party member AI occasionally has a brain fart and just lets bosses one shot them with highly telegraphed attacks.\n\nDespite all this I still had a very good time with Strikers and I think anyone who liked Persona 5 also will.",

I am pretty sure I saved in front of the last dungeon and I don't care much to start the game again to find out the biggest reveal of the story.\n\nThe game is very linear, you still don't get to choose what to do on days any more like the old personas. I used to really enjoy when the game was less linear and experiencing different sides of people would cause their arcana type to level up, or you could browse the shopping network on Sunday and get items. Choices are missing from this game and you are pulled along rails listening to a story that doesn't quite make you feel emotional to outweigh the dungeon crawler theme.",

The combat does require you to abuse the weaknesses of enemies as done in the original Persona franchise therefore at time MP usages can be draining during  a single run in the dungeons - so do keep in mind to find checkpoints and pop in and out of the dungeons to refresh the MCs MP and HP as well as switch party members. If your going to pick this up straight up spend as much time as you want in the cities you visit in the real world (in game) as there are things you might miss. Overall a great game with an always amazing sound track by Lyn, Lotus and the Atlus/ Toei did an amazing job!",

        "content": "The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand. HOWEVER, some significant flaws like aiming guns are broken as your crosshair moves up and down like an earthquake simply from moving it in either left or right directions.\n\nThe store is also watered down a tad as you used to be able to sell all your junk with a push of a button in persona 5. with strikers, you must sell each item individually as the \"sell all junk\" button does not exist anymore.\n\nEverything else gameplay-wise was fine from what I have seen except for some exploits due to how far you can jump to places, and in certain areas, if you look up, you can pass entier areas without going to the actual entrance, which I accidentally did and backtracked to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is..... how to put it..... probably the worst thing about this game. The removal of all the supporting members from the game and being left with just a few new ones hurt the story badly. The hub world feels empty because of this, as there is nothing to do or get more investment in the story (at least from what I saw from beating the first palace). \nThe story also feels completely unrelated to me, as the stakes for beating any of the palaces are super low. While in the first game, the cops in the story would have arrested you the moment you were suspicious, even at the last scene of the game. In this one, it feels like no one cares (except for one guy) despite you being a phantom thief. You actually had severe consequences in the story in the first one, but in this game, it's just a straight path with some little stumbles and no risk. Maybe it gets better after the first palace, but I didn't care to continue as it felt pointless. i could compare this to mementos side stories, but with extra flair. that's basically it.\n\nI'm sure some people love this stuff, and gameplay-wise, it's obviously not bad. But for me, this was just boring to continue, which is ironic considering this game has more action in it than persona 5.",

In fact, I think the overall story was much better than the original P5 game. Don't get me wrong, I still love both stories but I think the Monarchs make so much better antagonists than the Palace Rulers. I love how this game took the idea of the Phantom Thieves and brought the question of how humanity acts and relies on free will and isolation. I felt like all of the Monarchs were in the position that they are purely because of how they fell off their paths in life instead of just being pure evil. This led to the change of hearts being much more believable and made me wonder how the Monarchs got to be the leaders of the jail every time I got to a new one and how we were going to save them. Overall, this game improves the concept of the Phantom Thieves and brings a brand new game play style that works together so well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves good stories, good game play, or are just a fan of the Persona series in general.",

        "content": "I haven't played merciless/new game + yet but as of my base game experience so much fun, the gameplay is filled with flashy satisfying combos but many fights still require strategy and attention so it's such a perfect balance that it's addicting.  The writing is incredible as always and the characterization and interactions are arguably better than og persona 5 and royal.  The setting of the game as a summer roadtrip around Japan is genius and was a great breath of fresh air besides the familiar area of Shibuya.  The two main new characers Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions especially Zenkichi.  The visuals are also very pretty and refined especially the in-game cut scenes which honestly looked better than the anime cut scenes.  Overall I wanted more persona 5 and that's what this game gives you, exactly what I needed around this time.  The only complaints I have are the persona system with joker could be done a little better compared to previous p5 games, Lavenza and the velvet room in general should've been used in the plot a bit more or just change things up and make it more unique rather than \"Oh guess what you're a trickster of fate again\", and the plot near the end is pretty predictable and similar to P5R.  I can see why people don't like Sophia as well being the whole AI learns about the concepts of humanity thing but Sophia's interactions and expressions were very cute so it made up for it.  Every character gameplay wise is incredibly fun the best in my opinion being Makoto, Ryuji, and wolf(won't say who wolf is cuz spoilers) but the only complaint I have gameplay wise is Sophia, in a muso game I want to do big flashy moves or badass combos, with so much happening on the screen why would I want to practice timing perfect catches with a yoyo for sophia's combos how can I read her catches while watching every other enemy and dodging attacks, functionally her bless magic and healing are very helpful but that's all I really used her for her magic for bosses and mini bosses who were weak to bless or just healing team members she's the only character I found my self barely using in combat.\nOverall 9/10 very surprised and excited to do New Game +",

It's a mini persona 5 without a strict the strict calendar system, fast paced warriors combat and retains the Persona 5 dungeon crawling and mild stealth gameplay. The new characters are very likeable and all in all is a satisfying send off to the original Persona 5 continuity",

I highly recommend playing Persona 5 Royal before you play this game since Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5. If you go straight into Strikers, you won't understand some parts of the story. Fun beat em up game and great story, but some of the requests are pretty annoying to do. The crashes and FPS drops are somewhat annoying as well, but as long as you download the beta fix from Steam, you will be fine. Overall, I highly recommend this game :D 10/10",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.",

Characters are the lovable characters from P5, the story is just as interesting as the main game and they added in a lot of cool features that makes the game unique. Only complaint is that you can't do much in the overworld when you're not exploring Jails other than buy stuff, things like hang out with confidants and build your bonds like in the main game, but it makes up for that by adding in missions to do in the other Jails.",

        "content": "Wow, Just WOW.\n\nWhen I first heard of this, I kind of turned a blind eye to it thinking \"Pssh, A Musou Persona game? Not gonna work.\" \n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it started to grow on me. Ended up pre-ordering sometime in January. Got it 3 days early because of the Deluxe order. Wow.\n\nI am so glad I picked this up. I fell in love with the Persona series when I got to try out Persona 4. Dark, Gritty, comical and pretty real when it came to terms and understanding characters. Played the original and P4 Golden. Absolutely loved every aspect of the game. Saw it released on steam and bought it without even thinking. :)\n\nThen P5 was announced!\nPre-orderd the box set before the prices when to crap before release. Completely loved the game and finished it.\nPersona 5 Royal. . . . CRAP! got to get it! Started to replay the game with the extras and to experience the new section of the story. Got about 76 hours into the game and lost everything past the 16 hour mark after a brown out. Forgot to upload to PS plus. Also, long story short. PS4 Pro, No Internal harddrive. Modified external with 8tb Barracuda Pro. Every brownout/ loss of power wiped the drive. After that happened, 2 tb SSD with the 8tb in a usb3 case. Works fine now but added a 1000 UPS unit to it. Honestly haven't touched it since\n\nStrikers though, I was positively blown away by how well this worked. A Dynasty Warriors take on Persona is certainly refreshing way to spin off an already great game. All of the characters we know and love are spot on and the VA's reprized their rolls wonderfully{save for Joker}. Absolutely love Zenkichi and Sophia and the parts they play. The gameplay was fluid and fast paced when needed and the music from the original games and the reprized Musou variants plus their original takes work perfectly for the new style of gameplay. Even the subtle change in the music when you went into the sneak sections was a pleasing change. I wonder how many people caught onto that change when they played those parts.\n\nThe story played out very well and was a pretty good length. I was surprised that it totaled almost 33 hours without doing the extra mission. It is pretty engrossing if you ask me with all of the comical, stereotypical, and serious character building while keep the balance of surreal, light, and dark positions each and every character goes through and faces during each mission or challenge.\n\nAll in all. The Highlights about the games really to make this a great play Save for the few things that I have found that started to break the immersion of the game. First off, The VA's did a wonderful job playing their parts but I found that the sound balancing in the game started to break the game. I was finding out that alot of the music did not lower when the characters spoke and alot of time the Va's voice would start to blend or even be overpowered by the music. I heard this alot when Skull spoke his dialogue. He even had a few lines that were inaudible or something that was completely non-exhistant when he talked. The constant crashing when the game was first released, which thankfully, was fixed with the beta update they released a week or so later. But when I really started to see was the slowdown during gameplay or in full on battles. I was well above the Recommended when I was running it first on my I5 6500, OLOy DDR4 2666{Limited to 2400 because of processor}, and my 1060 GXT SSC card. I kept getting slowdowns when I had alot of effects going on in game with more than 6 enemies on screen. It was the worse when I made it to the underground \"sewer\" part of the first Prison. The section near the end of the \"sewer\" part where the water was on the floor at the end of the dungen.  Upgraded the Processor and motherboard while keeping my memory and Vid card. Ryzen 5 3600X. was the processor upgrade and the game played almost flawlessly. Even got better framerates that stayed constant 60FPS even in the final dungeon where there were up to 50+ enemies on the field. I also found it strange that there were side quest mini bosses that were incredibly hard when compared to the normal Bosses and End game boss. I died more on those side quest bosses then I did on the Main ones. Once you started to get up in levels, the enemies became to easy which made it hard to start to complete the Character quests and Move sets. Maybe I will mess with it soon in a harder difficulty mode to see if my current Mode playthrough was the reason.\n\nNow, my last quip was Joker. I guess they could not get the original VA? I mean, His voice was alot more gruff at certain points but they used alot of his Persona 5 voice clips. It was very off putting listening to him. Other than that. It was a great game and was very enjoyable to play. Now I'll just wait for any expansions or new unlockable to see in game. Heres Hoping. ;)\n\n",

        "content": "Aight This Review contains spoilers for Persona 5: Strikers and Persona 5: Royal so don't complain when i reveal Yusuke was the main villain the whole time\n\nOkay anyway I enjoyed this game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for 60 big ones unless you are an avid Persona Stan or you really enjoy this kind of Game. First off is the fact that the game likes crashing a lot and it also has a few glitches which might force you to close, which really sucks when you spend 30 minutes on the final boss fight and it crashes the next cutscene and I have to fight the boss all over again.\n\nNext is the story in General: If you played Persona 5, then you know the story of Persona 5: Strikers. There are bad guys in these palace like jails and it's up to the Phantom Thieves to change their hearts and take back their desires. Of course there is actually a false god who has been secretly pulling the strings and manipulating everything. It feels like you are playing a watered down fanfiction rather than an actual sequel with how similar it is to the main story. The only unique part of the story being Sophia but even then her plot is barely touched until the very end.\n\nNext are the characters: The main cast is back but it doesn't feel like they are back. They all act like parodies of themselves, like someone saw one scene in Persona 5 and based their entire personality off it. While its charming at first listening to the cast talk and crack jokes, there is only so many times we can hear about Ryuji's food obsession or Makoto's fist of justice or Yusuke being poor. The villains are all forgettable, their backstory is paper thin and the game tries to make it seem like they are morally grey characters or arent truly evil, but they dont even keep this pattern up half the time. Some villains are complete assholes who murder their parents, while others are boring and barely even criminals, like the guy who wrote a bad book. It felt like there was an attempt to make a villain who is good, but uses the wrong method like Takuto Maruki from Royal, but they all fall short. Maruki worked so well because he was a good guy and actually was attempting to do good, even if his methods and ways were wrong. The villains that try to seem redeemable are all murders whose control other people to force them to do their bidding. Even the twist villain who everyone could see coming just felt dry, like they needed someone to explain why EMMA even became a god in the first place.\n\nGameplay: The game play seems fun at first, but it quickly gets old after a while, it is just beat up the enemy, move forward, wow another ambush, beat up the enemy, fight a 10 minute mini boss, fight a 30 minute boss. There is just too much combat that feels unrewarding and dry, The time outside of the metaverse feels empty, like a poor imitation of the main games open world. The time progression system is completely uselss, and there is little to do outside except shop for groceries so you can have more sp and complete side request which just waste more time. Every area felt the same with no uniqueness, every battle felt the same, learn the enemies weaknesses and spam the move that works. Unlike the main game, which had a lot of flair, each battle lacks anything close to the art style and flair of the main game as you see all the game has to offer in about and hour of game play. God bless anyone who didnt buy the Legacy music because I could not stand listening to the same three combat songs over and over again. \n\nOverall this game is not worth $60, maybe $40 but i wouldn't go any higher, just wait for a sale if you really want it, also atlus pls fix your game I want to go one cutscene without crashing pls",

        "content": "This game is practically Persona 5 Lite. Contains a lot from base Persona 5, except social links and a restricted free roam. Time does not pass in this game when you do any sort of action, but instead only passes through story. It does feel rather cheaply made at first, though, since you can't run while free roaming, and all but two non party confidants were completely removed from the game because of [strike] low budget [/strike] convenient reasons. However, it shouldn't take much time to adjust to this.\n\nThe only gripe I can give this game is the combat. It works, but it's not great. Be warned, you will be dropped from full HP to 0 in less than a second many times in this game, and that's the game's biggest issue. I don't think they realized just how strong enemy moves were, so when you have 7 of them doing the same move all at once, it packs one hell of a punch. The majority of persona moves are also rather useless. Really, I never once used a physical skill, and I only used a magic skill a hand full of times. The only worth while skills in this game are stat buffs/debuffs, heals, and passives. Everything else, including skills like concentrate and charge, are completely worthless. Also, anything that was meant to hit all targets in the base game is also completely useless. It just costs more SP with a wider area of affect. Normal trash enemies don't need any debuffs to fight. The only thing you should use debuffs on is for anything that has a health bar on the top of the screen, and since it's only one enemy, you can save double the SP for just using the smaller area of effect debuffs.\n\nOverall, it's Persona 5 through and through with the only major change being Action RPG combat. If you liked P5's story and characters, you'll like this, and appreciate it too.",

PERSONA 5 IS AMAZING AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT PLAYING IT. All jokes aside, this game is really fun, once you get into the flow of combat, it is really enjoyable. It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.",

        "content": "Super well done Musou game, though sometimes can be a bit dizzying. The story was awesome, really fun, though still pretty similar to the typical persona formula, so slightly predictable at times, but still well done and touching. It actually made me cry a couple times on some themes that really hit home for me. The music is dope, as always, and I liked the variety, cause hearing the same one over and over can get old fast. And I think hard mode is well balanced, but be careful with merciless. (If you unlock it)\nSide Note: this is a sequel, so if you haven't played original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then I highly recommend playing one of those first, or watching someone's playthrough if you don't mind spoilers. Hopefully they'll make that available on PC soon for anyone without a PS4/5",

        "content": "TL;DR The only criteria you need to think about if you're considering playing is \"Did you like Persona 5?\" If the answer is yes, play this without question. I would NOT recommend this at all if you haven't played the original Persona 5, this builds up directly on top of Persona 5 and you'll feel lost if this is your first Persona game.\n\nI'd give this a 8.5/10, only because Persona 4 and 5 have set a very high standard, so obviously this cannot compete with that but you'll never feel like this was a low-effort cash grab. It's very much a good polished game worth your time and you shouldn't compare it to Persona 5 which had a wayyy longer development time and budget.\n\nWhile there are definitely some weak links, you'll never feel bad about it when you're playing, and I had as much a blast with this game as much as I did with the other main Persona titles. In fact, I actually prefer this action combat system over Persona's original turn-based combat. Any future Persona games using this sort of combat over turn-based combat would be a dream come true (sadly it won't happen but it's fun to think about)\n\nAgain, this is totally worth your money if you've played and liked the original Persona 5. I'm just sad it has ended and I'll have to wait a long time for another high-quality Persona game. I have very specific reasons for not giving it a perfect score but it's not for this review. I feel like there were some game design/level design issues and Sophia is an unlikable character for me personally. But then again, Persona games have always been cheesy, and all those issues won't really bother you when you're playing; they only seem worse in hindsight when you think about them afterwards.\n\nThank you Omega Force, P-Studio and Atlus for making this. I greatly enjoyed my time and now I feel like I'm in a void again now that this has ended.",

But I feel that they captured the feel of one nicely. The UI and menus look exactly like Persona 5 did, and the story and gameplay change work in this context. Most of the battles are fun but none get so challenging that you need to grind for hours on end. \n\nOne thing to note, I can't seem to launch or play this game full screen. I don't think it was made to be played on a keyboard so I'd recommend a controller. Since thats how I play I have to launch in bigpicture mode...which wants to launch the game in fullscreen. Sometimes just launching the game is...a struggle. so I mostly leave it open all day to save myself the headache.  I'd say go out and buy it...just not on steam.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers (or scramble if you're playing the JP version) is a fairly good ActionJRPG. HOWEVER, it has a very big problem of crashing, sometimes at the worst possible time (I have literally had crashes immediately after finishing a boss fight losing upwards of an hour of progress). I do still recommend the game to anyone wanting to dip their feet into the SMT/Persona series, though it does not only contain spoilers for the base Persona 5 game (takes place not too long after the end of Persona 5) and it also expects you to know the general gist of the plot of Persona 5 as well. Until a patch does come out addressing the stability issues though, I must say to save very frequently to avoid loss of progress. Game length wise is about 40 hours doing most of the side missions/Requests on Normal difficulty so you do get your money's worth, and New Game+ does exist if you feel like rerunning at higher difficulties.",

They did this game a huge amount of Justice, I honestly felt like crying when I beat the game, mainly because of the fact that the Visuals are extremely beautiful and you can relate to the Characters in most situations, and mostly because I didn't want it to End. ATLUS made an extremely phenomenal game that I hope gets nominated for the Game Awards and wins at least one Award, because it definitely deserves it.",

And the more open dungeon design and action-based combat will make playing the original feel a little cramped and dusty. Definitely play Persona 5 before playing this game though, as this is more of a summer vacation side-story experience and it really hinges on you knowing all these characters from the previous game. And for anyone worried about this being action-oriented instead of turn-based, don't worry. As someone who struggles with twitchy games, this one was pretty easy to play.",

        "content": "I think of all the Personas I've played, this one really helped cement the team, not just as Phantom Thieves, but as actual friends. This one felt so much more personal, like the voice actors had SO MUCH FUN playing these characters and adding their personal touch to it. I especially loved the new characters as well, especially Sophia. She made me tear up multiple times. My favorite team was the P4 Investigation Team, but this game really made me connect the Phantom Thieves so much more. \n\nNow moving to combat, combat feels GOOD. Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my fight.\n\n10/10. Gonna miss the Phantom Thieves a bunch.",

Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable. Real shame. But I'm not gonna complain, since things turned out pretty good.",

When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively. Aight yall be good people and WEAR YO MASK!",

        "content": "I recommend this game but it is more of a cautionary one.\n\n*Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5. It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)",

        "content": "I haven't met many people in recent years who hadn't heard of Persona 5 in some fashion. Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus. Well done, Omega Force.",

        "content": "Strong yes, solid crossover between the Dynasty Warriors style gameplay and Persona's elements. Only tip I would have is beat Persona 5 (Atlus, PC port PLS) before playing P5 Strikers, this game leans pretty heavily on Persona 5's themes, story and characters, so it can be tough to understand some of the story's depth without it.\n\nPros-\n- Great persona combat systems woven into Dynasty-Warriors style gameplay makes for a completely unique experience. Action-based persona combat is crazy fun.\n- Easy to run - not super demanding but strangely doesn't perform well at native 4K on a 2080ti, but that might be a me thing\n- Classic super deep persona story, shorter but not in a bad way. Easily 40-60 hours for someone experienced in the genres, more if you're not.\n- Plenty of additional challenges like Merciless difficulty on NG+, tougher boss fights and others to keep me coming back for more.\n\nCons-\n- No Ultrawide Support - I can forgive this for Persona 4 golden since it's a port of an older Vita game, but this game is new, come on.\n- Locked to either 30 or 60fps - again, modern games shouldn't have hard FPS caps.\n- Depth of the combat system can make things unforgiving for newer players - allowing for tweaking of individual parts of the game's difficulty like Persona 4 Golden has would go a long way for some players.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to the original Persona 5 but does not quite match the sheer magnitude of perfection that its predecessor has. I also can't recommend that you buy this game unless you have played the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal because it is a direct sequel and it makes no effort to catch the player up to speed.\n\n\nPersona 5 Strikers' new characters (Zenkichi and Sophia) fit seamlessly into the original cast, both of these new additions bring something new to the table, invoking both memorable dialogue and continuities that tie the main story together. The main story of Persona 5 Strikers follows up on Vanilla P5, it takes place during the summer after the main protagonist returns to his hometown and he makes a return to Yongen-Jaya to meet up with his old friends, aiming to do something fun for the summer. Unfortunately, this time of tranquility only lasts for so long until they meet their new conflict, which I'll leave you to discover.\n\nIt's combat is both addicting and intriguing, drawing the player in with immense strategy and its upbeat persona-esque music engaging its player. It's entirely different from P5's turn based combat but retains its strategy in exploiting weaknesses and debuffing your enemies. \n\nThe only problems I have with P5S is that the dungeons sometimes force fights on you, and it's incredibly difficult to manage SP. Also, I think I had somewhere around 4-5 crashes along my playthrough, so it's important to save often. All in all, P5S is a great game and is most definitely worth checking out.",

If you haven't play P5 yet, I wouldn't really recommend this game as you'll be left in the dark about certain events and the dynamics between the returning members of the Phantom Thieves. Overall, this is a wonderfully done action game that ever Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "Do you like beating up hordes of faceless goons in a nightmare world created by the twisted perspectives of highly insecure people? If so, Persona 5 Strikers is the game for you.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the Persona series in general, or Persona 5 in particular, to enjoy Strikers. P5S is a musou-style beat-em-up/hack-and-slash free-for-all, so if you've ever played any of the Warriors games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors), you know exactly what this is. That's not to say it's bad; in fact, just the opposite. P5S had me smiling from start to finish because it was simply fun, a thing I had long forgotten video games could be. In a world full of roguelikes, open-world sandboxes, MMORPGs, and JRPGs, the Warriors games simply put you in a room with a hundred bad guys and let you mow them down with manic energy. If that's the sort of thing you find gratifying, you'll like P5S.\n\nThis game is set not too long after the events of Persona 5. The band gets back together for a wild summer tour of Japan, but their plans are interrupted when hearts start changing without any apparent cause. The authorities blame the Phantom Thieves, who are forced to investigate and clear their name. Along the way, they encounter a Lewis Carroll enthusiast, have a classic mix-up in a Japanese hot spring, meet a living AI, bury a cop in sand, nearly get pummeled to death by brainwashed islanders, and fight a giant...um...phallus in a chariot (I'm not even kidding).\n\nIn true Persona style, every fight is a bombastic and flashy beatdown. Whereas other musou games do not penalize direct approaches, P5S rewards you for ambushing enemies and getting in opening hits while traversing dungeons. P5S not only draws on the Warriors franchise for inspiration, but also feels at times like the investigation parts of Ace Attorney and the stealth parts of Metal Gear Solid, while bosses and their dungeons often feel inspired by NiGHTS into Dreams. Using the eponymous personas adds a Pokemon-style RPG element as you swap party members and their personas in and out to maximize attack effectiveness. It's a lot of fun and there's a lot of replay value, especially since the game rewards you for revisiting places you've already been to for additional bonuses. The soundtrack is continuously popping off with jazzy, funky melodies during fights that encourage you to do everything from blow party poppers in your enemies' faces to skateboarding into them at high speed.\n\nIf Strikers is the swan song for Persona 5, then it could not have hit a much higher note. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like the over-the-top antics of any Warriors game and you've been wondering who that one character from Smash Ultimate is, then Persona 5 Strikers will take your heart.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers The Review\n\nPlayed On: PC (Steam)\nCompleted Date: 3/17/2021\nPlaytime: 72.5 hours\n\nStatus: Completed 100%.  \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not Persona 5 Royal) and follows the same loveable crew on a road trip journey. It uses a new hack and slash action RPG combat inspired in part by Musuo games like Dynasty Warriors but is still ostensibly Persona.\n\nGraphics [80/100]:\nThe graphics of Persona 5 Strikers follows the same style of the main entry using the stylized cel shading graphics. These graphics pop and look great.  They ooze style and feel unique.  Strikers is a bit more colorful compared to the original.  The overall package is fantastic and well thought out.  If you liked the style of Persona 5 or anime in general you will enjoy this as it is more of the same.  \n\nBattle System / Combat / Core Gameplay [92/100]:\nThe battle system in Persona 5 Strikers is a massive departure from the original.  It is no longer a turn based JRPG game but now it is an action based hack and slash that uses the ideas from the Persona world. That said, combat is fantastic and fun. It is both fast paced and strategic as you have to abuse the system, as any good Persona game would have you do, to beat the mini bosses and bosses since they have large health pools. The difference is you have to dodge and move and input commands as you go. When it came down to it I found this all very fun and all of the characters have unique and different play styles that made for a fun and challenging game. The game does abandon most of the outside of combat gameplay from the original game which keeps the game moving steady but you do miss social links for sure.\n\n Audio [75/100]:\nThe voice acting and music is good. Voice acting is top notch and everyone nails it in the English dub. The music is also good but lacks some of the best songs from the original. It still has the feels but with the missing songs it doesn\u2019t quite have the same pizzaz that the original brought. I still enjoyed it.  \n\nControls [71/100]:\nControls are responsive for the most part. There is a slight delay whenever you open a menu that you must wait out prior to doing things but it\u2019s easy to become used to that. All the menus are animated so it\u2019s not bad having to wait a second. Characters can feel a bit loose when running but I got used to it quickly enough.\n\nStory [82/100]:\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers follows after the original game and while this story isn\u2019t quite as good it still brings it. We get extended time with the entire crew as we go on a road trip and this is a great experience and I find that this group fits incredibly well with this format. We begin unraveling the metaverse yet again and from there the story unfolds and the intricacies can be found and present themselves very well.\n\nExtras [60/100]:\nThe side quests (requests) are almost entirely go collect something or go kill something. These can be fun since some of the kill quests are pretty challenging and the rewards are good. There are occasional quests to explore parts of the dungeon without porting or getting spotted and these are different and fun as well.  As a whole though the side quests offer little story or interesting add ons outside of challenge and good rewards. \n\nOverall [87/100]:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a fantastic game that has a combat system that is fun and engaging while being simple and flashy as well. The story is good and interesting and the characters are still as fantastic as ever. If you are a fan of Persona 5 this is a must play. For others as this is a direct sequel I would recommend Persona 5 first then this. If you didn\u2019t like Persona 5 this plays so differently that you may still like it as long as it wasn\u2019t the aesthetics that you didn\u2019t enjoy.",

        "content": "[h1] TLDR; Poor PC port that crashes and fails to utilize SSDs, hilariously bad/lazy writing (if you disliked P5's writing, this is worse), and satisfying-but-boring battle gameplay. [/h1]\n\n[b] Fair Warning [/b]: My playtime does not reflect the length of this game, and I have not finished it due to being utterly frustrated with my aforementioned issues.\n\nWhen this got announced for PC, I was pretty excited to get some more breadcrumbs of Persona on the platform, even if it were just a Warriors-style spinoff. However, the final product given has left a LOT to be desired.\n\nThe first thing you may notice, at least if you have the game installed on an SSD, is the straight up abysmal bootup and loading times. Like, at least couple MINUTES to load into the intro screens. This game is definitely not as demanding as the original P5, and that game takes no effort to load on a disk drive for a console that's already out the door. On top of that, the game will constantly freeze and crash on loading screens. I've had 4 crashes in 24 hours, and 2 of those came on the same exact loading screen. The devs, however, do have a beta branch out as of this writing in the hopes of diagnosing and fixing these crashes.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is how the writing in this release is just straight up not good. Some characters fall further into their awful stereotypes set in the original game (Ryuji & Ann are Dumb & Dumber, Makoto is even more bland, etc.). The two new characters to the group are just straight up depth-less copies of previous Persona franchise characters ( [spoiler] Sophia is super cute but seems to have the same character conflict as Aigis from P3, and Zenkichi has an eerily similar backstory and conflict as Dojima from P4 [/spoiler] ). There's even a bathhouse scene taken straight from Persona 3, except with the interesting bits removed and replaced with a generic slapstick punchline. Some positives to point out, though: the slice-of-life moments in this game feels just as heartwarming as the original game, Morgana is much less annoying, and Haru has way much more character and plays a bigger role in this game than she ever did before.\n\nThe third thing you may notice, the battle gameplay in this game feels confusing at first, but actually feels really clean and satisfying once you grasp it! However that quickly goes away once you realize the gameplay is just: travel to this place, battle a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, defend Futaba against a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, battle a boss and a crowd of enemies to complete part of the level. Repeat about three times and that's an entire arc of this game in the simplest terms possible. The battle gameplay is honestly not that frustrating (except: [spoiler] the massively disappointing Shadow Joker boss battle with an outrageous change in normal gameplay that honestly feels like a dumb gimmick rather than a difficulty spike [/spoiler]). If you enjoy Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, you probably won't have any problems here.\n\nAll in all, this is a ridiculously disappointing game. It's clunky/broken at times, cringey even for Persona standards, and just boring, confusing, and frustrating overall. At least the game's performance problems are in the process of being fixed.",

        "content": "Tl;dr: Great game, not just a Musou clone, well worth checking out.\n\nA worthy successor to Persona 5 and highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the original.\n\nRight out the gate, it's important to note that this is a rather different game to Persona 5 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The art direction is, as usual for the Persona 5 games, absolutely gorgeous with somehow even MORE stylish menu designs that incorporate the other members of the phantom thieves. \n\nThe level design, while linear, is pretty par for the course when it comes to a \"Warriors\" game, with large, linear maps that offer decent amounts of challenge. But this is where Strikers diverges from the usual formula, as the team behind the game has put a lot of effort into blending the gameplay style of the warriors games with the RPG elements of Persona 5, as instead of a single instanced map with objectives to defend, Strikers instead opts to thrust players into a large dungeon-like map with multiple instanced rooms, each filled with roaming symbol encounters that will drop the player into a small-scale \"1 v 100\" battle.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Persona 5 Strikers to pretty much anyone, be they fans of Persona, Dynasty Warriors-Style Games, or even neither of those. Easy 9/10 game for me.",

I would still recommend the game to fans of the original, however until some of these crashing issues are fixed I would maybe steer clear of the PC port and pick up the PS4 or Switch versions instead.",

It's a great excuse to have some more fun with the lovable cast of P5 this time on PC. Honestly, Despite what was said by the devs, I don't think this is too much fun for most people who haven't played the original P5 or Royal. Consider playing P5 before this to really get the most out of it. PS3's are pretty cheap nowadays, and if not it's pretty stable on RPCS3 *wink*. If you've played P5, It's an easy 10/10. If not please play P5 and then come here. If there's really no way for you to play P5 then maybe hold out for a sale cause the combat's still fun but honestly this game is more fun if you already love the cast. It goes down to like a 6/10 if you don't know the cast and past events. It doesn't spoil anything from P5 too big and you can still switch up the order but it's not recommended.\nUnlike this game. For me it's one of the few bright spots of this whole lockdown and an easy recommendation.",

        "content": "I'm impressed at how well they were able to implement the style of persona from an action jrpg into a hack and slash, especially since this is the series' first dive into the genre. Characters are consistent with their portrayals in base p5, though it stands to note that this game follows a story where persona 5 royal never happened. This game absolutely lives up to the legacy of the series, and the new characters I really enjoyed. Music was incredible, definitely enough to stand on its own. Setting was incredible. Plot progression was incredible. If anything at all, I feel like the writing in this game did feel a little on the nose and cheesy at times, but not at all enough to affect my overall opinion.\n\n[h1]SPOILERS [/h1]\n[spoiler]The final boss was easy. Like, really easy. Throughout my entire playthrough, I pretty much exclusively stuck with Joker (for obvious reasons), Haru (for heat riser and the fact that killing enemies with her rocket launcher was funny), Sophia (because she had a great moveset), and Yusuke (though I switched him out with Zenkichi during the Kyoto jail). While they were hovering in the mid level 70s by the final boss, my other team members ended under level 60. When you had to split up and fight the meatballs on the towers, I had no trouble spamming their moves and made it out without a single person dying. Even when you get all the meatballs and Joker has to kill EMMA, I just spammed Maeigaon and killed it without taking any damage. Honestly the Archangel in the room right before EMMA was more challenging in my opinion. The hardest boss of the entire game was Shadow Joker, and that's only because you do such little damage to him. I only got out of that boss fight by spamming health and sp healing items and wailing on him for a solid 10 minutes. Finally, I want to bring attention to Zenkichi. He absolutely stole the show in the entire game. There was so much passion that went into his performance, and, when paired with the writing of his character, made him the best part of the entire game. Also, as a temporary musical nerd, seeing Valjean appear in the awakening scene was an out of body popoff experience. The portrayal of Valjean as a persona was perfect (it even had the 24601 on his chest). But seeing Valjean specifically as the persona of Zenkichi was the most incredible thing because Valjean fits so perfectly with Zenkichi's character. AND it drew the parallel of Akane being Zenkichi's Claudette like oh my god that was absolutely genius.[/spoiler]\n\nHonestly, it's astounding to me what they were able to accomplish with this game, and it absolutely gave me the same feeling of unending emptiness of the mainline persona games when it ended (which is crazy because no social links and also half the playtime wow).",

        "content": "This is my first game from the Persona-series. I have watched a bit of Persona 5, but that was it. I also haven't watched any content to P5Strikers, or better, P5Scramble. This is why I was surprised that it was a Hack-n-slash game, however, it works really well with the setting. And the story, oh boy, good characters, good plot and overall a great experience. Every character has its onw playstyle, be it the allrounder Joker who has really save moves, Ryuji who has massive burst-options that leave him wide open for attacks or Makoto or Morgana who specialize in buffing and healing their teammates. If you like the Persone-style and look for a good hack-n-slash, play this, it's like a 40-hour game and worth every single cent. The only downside to this game is its instability, it sometime crashes, not often, but often enough for you to start saving all the time, however, you can't save during cutscenes or textboxes, you have to wait till cutscenes are over and just pray. If there is a hot-fix, ill give it a perfect score of 10/10, but till now it is a 9.5/10.\nMusic is, as expected from the Persona-games, great. I can't choose between \"Life will change\", \"Aria of the soul\" and \"Anti-HERO\".",

        "content": "I'm going to preface this review by saying that there have been a lot of technical issues reported by many people and I personally experienced some frequent crashes around the third Jail of this game. However, with the new beta patch applied, those issues seem to be resolved and I have had a crash free experience! So make sure you opt into the beta up until the patch goes live properly. \n\nAlso, this game does use Denuvo Anti-Temper, which is controversial for many reasons including proven performance impacts as seen by games that have had the middleware removed. Some people very much dislike Denuvo, so it's only fair to make sure you're aware that is is there in case that is something that would impact your purchase. In that case, you may wish to consider either not purchasing the game, or seeking out its PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch ports if you own those systems.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can talk about how I actually feel about the game itself.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a spin off of...Persona 5, funnily enough. It's by Koei Tecmo, the developers of the Warriors games. I personally am not a fan of those games, so I was pretty relieved when I found that Strikers is actually not a Warriors game. While it shares some of the base components e.g. controlling a party of heroes fighting large groups of enemies, the similarities pretty much end there.\n\nIn terms of combat, the game is a lot more focused on keeping your party alive, managing your HP/SP, and taking advantage of your enemies' weaknesses to gain control over the battle. In that regard, those tactical elements make the game feel strangely a lot like a Persona game in execution even with the change to real time action combat. Like many of the other Persona games, you also visit the Velvet Room to acquire and fuse new Personas throughout the game to give you more powerful tools to deal with the enemies. Social links are not in this game, but are replaced with a 'bond' system where you gain points to spend on upgrades for your party by interacting with them, cooking new recipes, and completing requests.\n\nThe ways these mechanics compliment each other help to make this feel a lot different from other spin offs and make it feel much more like a companion to the main Persona games rather than just another cash grab. Added to this, this isn't another dancing game, or non-canon 'it was all a dream' type spin off, but an actual direct sequel to Persona 5. However, this does mean that the game will spoil the events of Persona 5.  This makes this game kind of a strange choice to release considering that game is not on PC, but it was likely easier to port a game that was already in active development. \n\nIf you have only played the original Persona 5, you will not be spoiled for the events of Royal as this game started development before Royal. Atlus likely also did not share any of the new plot elements of the re-release with Koei Tecmo, so Royal is not referenced at all in this game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game much if you're a newcomer to the series, but if you are a Persona fan that enjoyed the hell out of 5, this feels pretty much like more Persona 5. In terms of story, it does retread some elements from the previous game and lift some elements into the new story and many of the 'twists' of the game's story are pretty easy to see coming. If you've played other Persona games, or are just generally familiar with the tropes of these types of games, you'll see where the story is going pretty easily. That being said, it is still a well executed and enjoyable story even if predictable.\n\nLastly...the music. Yeah. This a Persona game. It's got pretty great music.\n\nWhy are you still reading this and not playing Persona 5 Strikers?",

The story is great as a continuation of the original game, the gameplay is always exciting with new mechanics I have never seen in a musou game before, the new characters are 2 of my favorite in the entire franchise, and the soundtrack might be my favorite soundtrack of all time! The only gripe about the game is the lack of the original P5 on the pc so this game is almost inaccessible for new fans of the series of the masterpiece that is P4G!",

They are different in terms of gameplay and I would say that Strikers is much easier but nevertheless it delivers and touches.... The only usual thing of Persona series that kinda dissapoints me is their endings which are usually bittersweet and leave you with emptiness and need for a hug :)\n\nI should add that one thing that an asian (japanese in particular) cuisine foodie should be prepared for getting really hungry periodically while playing, 'cos the characters like to eat different stuff and discuss it in a very appetizing manner :)",

        "content": "Interesting experience for fans of dynasty warrior type games, disappointing experience for a persona fan. Graphics for the game even on the max graphics settings are OK at best. The models in persona 5 are so much more crisp while the models in persona 5 strikers are blurry and hard to look at when far away. After playing persona 5, I have to admit that the characters have gotten stale for me. All of the arcs that the characters went through in persona 5 are pretty much just reused in this game, making it seem very lazy to say the least. A character that really grinds my gears is Sophia. Her character development is pretty much a sh*tty version of a certain someones character development in persona 3. No social links is also a real bummer. It was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed persona 5 and without them the game really feels like its missing something. Another thing I would like to point out is the fact that they make you go back into the real world and sit through two loading screens just to recover your SP. And its not like there's any incentive to go back to the real world. There's no social links, the day doesn't change, and the area your in remains exactly the same until you manage to drag yourself through the jail. Every time you try to do a persona attack it freezes time disrupting any natural flow the game could have had. As for the soundtrack, there's a few soundtracks I like and a few that are pretty terrible. The soundtrack I found most enjoyable was the soundtrack to the first jail, Love te Wonderland. Otherwise, it mostly goes downhill from there. Overall, the games not terrible and may be enjoyable to fans of the hack and slash genre, but to everyone else I wouldn't recommend it.",

        "content": "THERE MAY BE MINOR SPOILERS IN THE LAST SECTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING AND JUST WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S WORTH IT READ THE BEGINNING AND THEN SKIP TO THE END.\n\nSo I finally finished P5S, after 38 hours I can write this review, I will say that I am quite new to this series of games I have only played P5R which to this day is still my favorite game without a doubt, I finished it twice and got all the trophies on PS4, but I have known more and more of its predecessors P3, P4 wich is my next persona on the list P4G, but now I will talk about what I thought of P5S and also compare it with its predecessor P5R although P5 is canon.\n\nDespite the big change that is a musou, and other important changes such as no confidants and many other things that are not here P5S is not a bad game or anything the story that is the main thing that despite being much shorter than P5R is still one of those that hooks you and there is always something new and unexpected waiting for you ahead, P5S gives you a worthy story that as has become customary ends up teaching you something about life.\n\nin those 38 hours I didn't get bored enough to stop playing even though sometimes the combat got repetitive and the only thing you got to do sometimes was spamming buttons and powers with more and more powerful enemies in front, but let's be honest it's difficult to make a game where that doesn't happen, considering the style of P5S what always kept me there was the story, the conversations, the events, everything that didn't have to do with combat was what made me get up and say \"I'm going to play P5S for a while\" and that's where I want to go now and I'll talk a bit about the differences I saw in the monarchs to the palace rulers but that's after talking a bit about the ending of both games because I just want to, so spoilers coming up now.\n---------------------------------------------------\nSPOILER OF THE ENDING OF P5 ROYALE AND P5 STRIKERS \n \n[spoiler] Konoe, Ichinose and finally EMMA remind me a lot of Maruki and his ideals and desires to avoid human suffering, to create a reality or place where Anger, suffering, crying, death, among many others do not happen a paradise according to their Owners, but all those named except EMMA had a why they do it, Konoe for the suffering and abuse from his father, Ichinose because of the lack of love from her parents since they passed away and the lack of affection from her relatives who made her feel like a heartless doll and finally Maruki who after having \"lost\" Rumi and seeing Sumire's guilt and sadness over the death of Kasumi, all of them saw or suffered some kind of pain, this pain made them create the need to prevent the rest of the world from living something similar but in exchange for what? In exchange for the freedom of the people that although they would never suffer again, they would lose the power to be free, to think, to act for themselves, they lost the happiness of achieving goals, achieving dreams since everything they desired ended up being granted, they were at the mercy of their new ruler. That is a false reality in which at least in P5R they let you choose whether to live in a happy lie or return to reality where pain and suffering are part of what makes us human, although both endings are similar in terms of ideals and thoughts they are quite interesting at least to see as they are not 100% the same and there are differences in some of the things they want to achieve but they all did the same thing, they escaped from the truth and believed that escaping was the best thing for the rest without leaving them with the possibility of getting out of there themselves, although deep down especially Maruki were people who only wanted to see others happy but during that path that they forged they were leaving what it really means to be happy.\n And this is as far as I want to go with this subject, I think you get the main idea of what I wanted to say. [/spoiler]\n--------------------------------------\nMINOR SPOILERS FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MONARCHS AND PALACE RULERS\n\n[spoiler] now i will talk about a difference I felt in relation to the villains in P5S and P5R, I mean I am talking about the prison monarchs, again i will avoid naming them but there is something that differentiates them all from the palace rulers and that frankly is the biggest difference between the two games.\n the palace rulers are evil people who have done harm to people both abusing them, stealing from them and using them for their own benefit, unlike what I see in the monarchs who are people who may have suffered some trauma in the past and have used that power to hide and finally feel acknowledged and yes they brainwashed the masses but In the end they could finally be changed to the right path and have not committed crimes like the palace rulers did that is the main difference between the two games in P5S I felt a real remorse from them and the will to change while the palace rulers was the opposite and just hoped they would pay for their crimes with jail time, For the monarchs they could still do the Right thing. [/spoiler]\n-----------------------------------------\nThe truth is that I wanted to talk about these two things because they really stuck with me, but beyond that while the game has not been a slap in the face as it was for me P5R and there is not as much content as we are used to is a good continuation to the events of the original and a good change that at least I am satisfied, if you ask me is it worth playing this game? I would say yes, if you are new to Persona and you have nowhere to play P5 or P5R you should at least watch it on YouTube or read around so you are not lost with the characters and story of the previous one, if you have played it I can strongly recommend P5S it is completely worth it, honestly it is a good fan service if you wanted more story with the phantom thieves which was what I really wanted and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\nI haven't talked about everything the game has to offer but I'am not the only one doing a Review, But I can say one thing for sure.\n\nis it worth it?\n\nit's totally worth it.",

        "content": "I wasn't sure if I want to pick yes or no but decided to go with no, since I had a kinda hard time really enjoying it. Let me explain why.\n\nBattles\nThe controls in the battles are awful! Yes it is based on DW, but feels way worse. The lock on isn't working properly, sometimes you don't see anything because it's too colorful. Some enemies left the battle area to a point where my characters couldn't go, so I had to wait for them to come back.\n\nGenre\nFor me it feels like they just mixed up all current popular genres to make money out of it. Platformer, Hack'n'Slash, RPG, just put it together, it will work somehow. But it feels so out of place and especially the platformer parts are super annoying for me.\n\nChracters&Story\nThe characters are amazing as always, the story feels like a copy from Persona 5.\n\nGraphics\nAre amazing, BUT it's way too colorful in some parts, even with the third eye it was hard to find the way and I haven't even played till harder levels yet.\n\nBugs\nThe game crashed a few times on me, not only this, but enemies leave the arena. Was a no no.\n\n\nIn my opinion not worth the full price.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Scramble: the Phantom Strikers is very good. When I first heard about Scramble and how it was going to be a W-Force game, I was so disappointed since I'm not a fan of musou games and their formula. But this is far from your typical base defense/attack Musou game, it is far more like Persona 5 in it's gameplay, but instead of turn based battles, you have Musou style combat. There isn't any dumb base defense. All the levels feel like levels from Persona 5, and you only goal is to beat the enemies you are attacking at the moment.\n\nThe story is what you would come to expect from a Persona story if you've played all the games and spin-offs. It does some special things, and I wish it delved deeper into some characters [spoiler]I wish they just said that Ichinose was coping with autism or something and explored her more, but she serves her purpose, I just had to read between the lines to not see her as shounen villain of the week.[/spoiler] \n\nBut the with the gameplay and story, I'd say this is the best Persona spin-off ever. I wouldn't say it's Persona 5-2. But I would easily consider this Persona 5-1.5. Persona 4 Arena is a great fighting game that takes great advantage of what Persona is, but this feels like an actual continuation of a mainline Persona game in both gameplay and story.\n\nOne thing you may not like is characters over explaining things, or back and forths where characters just repeat the same things at each other, more so than Persona 5, but if you look past that, or enjoy that stuff, then it should be fine.\n\nSadly the localization is pretty crummy. ATLUS West is 10 years behind in their localization style. I'd say it's even worse than Persona 5, but at least there didn't seem to be anything censored here. Part of the issue is not having dedicated translations for both the English dub and for the real audio. There are so many issues with the translation that I think most everyone will notice if they play with the real audio, regardless of your level of Japanese. Also the Western name is so bad and unneeded and psychotic. The name change from \"Persona 5 Scramble: the Phantom Strikers\" to \"Persona 5 Strikers\" is indicative of the localization changes you should expect in the game itself. I took over 250 screenshots of lines that I felt were inaccurate, as well as some notes, and I hope one day we can fix these problems.\n\nFor technicalities of the PC version: it can run crustily. Music seems to stop in certain places, there are minor frame drops on my 5 year old GPU. There are crashes during loading screens. I think the biggest issue for me is how bad anti-aliasing is. I needed to play at 1440p to get an acceptable level of non-jaggedness, and that ate away at performance. Plus the game doesn't have built in supersampling, so you need to change the resolution of your computer yourself.\n\nThere are quite a few FMVs, which is a shame, but I'll accept that this is probably a limitation of the engine. The cutscene quality makes up for their existence. But FMVs have a problem where they can stutter sometimes, and during an emotional moment, that sucks. Also FMVs should have been rendered at 60fps.\n\nSo, good game, needs some technical work. Denuvo sucks and brings the quality down for me, but not enough for this to be a negative review. Biggest issue is the outmoded translation. Only modders will be able to fix that. I hope I can contribute in some way.",

        "content": "Same great cast from the base game. Fairly engaging plot of a decent length. The new characters are all fantastic. As usual from P5 the presentation in terms of audio and voice acting as well as the visual presentation is crisp and to an really high standard. \n\nThe gameplay is that of a warriors game though with the RPG elements of persona fitting in in a really natural way. If you don't like the gameplay of other warriors games then you probably wont enjoy this one, though if you want more of the P5 cast and story then i can still recommend playing on easy mode and it may surprise you.\n\nI can make that recommendation since this is one of the best warriors style games out there. All of the characters are fun to play and the combat is so satisfying, it tones down a lot of the warriors series main features to allow for the new content but that rounds off the experience really well to make for a game thats just fun to play.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you liked the base P5 or are a fan of good warriors games then give this a go. If you don't like the genre then perhaps its worth skipping. But everything this game does it does really well.",

        "content": "[h1]This game is Amazing but not without flaws ( well the flaws are more due to the port and not the game itself )[/h1]\n\n[b]Persona 5 Strikers shows that Musou can still feel fresh and that Atlus is not done suprising us.[/b]\n\n[h1]The gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is basically a mix between Musou ( Warriors ) style games ( Dynasty warriors, one piece pirate warriors etc. ) and the core formula of Shin Megami Tensei / Persona.\n\nYou'll have your basic Musou combos by combining \u25a3 and \u25b3 and in addition to that you can use your Persona and their abilities. \nThe gameplay may seem pretty basic at first but when you start facing strong enemies on higher difficulties you will need to switch between your Persona to have the right resistance against the attack you're about to receive, switch to a Persona that can exploit the enemy weakness, use \"technical skills\" by inflicting a status ailment on the enemy and then using a skill that benefits from that ailment etc.\n\nDuring your fights you'll be able to use your environment to attack your enemies in different way as well as dodge incoming attacks. Certain bosses have special interactions with some of these environmental attacks, but i wont spoil anything there you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nIn contrary to a standard Musou game you don't have zones to capture, it's closer to Persona in the fact that you engage a shadow and a group of enemy spawn ( of course you can ambush them like in Persona 5 ).\n\nThe bosses are pretty fun but they are sponges, they have a lot of hp and the fights can get a bit long ( but Persona has the same problem ).\n\nThe palaces are not very memorable and some of them are downright annoying.\n\nI recommend progressing through the game on max difficulty so you can actually see and use all the mechanics it has to offer and only use the Easy difficulty when you have to grind because some things take forever to get ( for example bond level in the post game ).\n\n[h1]The story and the characters[/h1]\nThe story is decent, it's not as good as a mainline entry but it's good enough to get you hooked.\nYou'll follow the Phantom thieves on a trip to different Japanese cities to clear their palaces ( called Jails in the game ), the interactions with the other characters are fun but you wont have the depth of other Persona games and their social links because this mechanic is not in the game, it's replaced by a general bond level which you gain points for by fighting, doing certain quests and spending time with the characters. ( yes this means you can't romance futaba the best girl )\n\nThe characters include the ones we all know and love from Persona 5 and it's nice to spend some time with them again.\nThe new characters are also nice and pretty well written .\n\nthe antagonists, their story and motives are decent.\n\n[h1]The art[/h1]\nThe game looks just like Persona 5 so i don't have too much to say about that, if you like the graphical style of P5 you'll love Strikers'.\nThe animations are nice and fluid and every character has different animations inside and outside of combat.\nThe all out attacks and Showtime are nice and flashy and different between each characters.\n\n[h1]The soundtrack[/h1]\nThe Japanese voice acting is very good ( i didn't try the english one ).\nThe musics are by the same singer as Persona 5's musics and they are really freakin' good. Some are subjectively better than what we got in Persona 5 such as What You Wish For or Daredevil.\nThe sounds in the fights are similar to what we've seen in Persona 5, down to when Joker calls a persona.\n\n[h1]How long to beat ?[/h1]\nStrikers is much shorter than the other Persona entries, in 43.4Hrs in beat the game once in Hard difficulty and once on Merciless in NG+. I've read all the text, participated in all the events i could, finished the inmate registry and got all the success on Steam.\nThis doesn't make it worse than other entries, if you were not a fan of how much Slice of Life stuff there was in other Persona games you'll prefer the direction of Strikers, there's still filler stuff but it's way more focused on the story and gameplay.\n\n[h1]My main complaints with the game[/h1]\nAt its current state the game sometimes crashes during loadings ( i got about 10 crashes in my playtime which is not a lot but it's still annoying, especially after a hard fight )\n\nFarming bond experience is a pain in the ass, it takes forever if you don't use exploits.\nKeep in mind that you can use an exploit to \"bypass\" the bond experience issue and i did use it.\nFarming Persona Points to level up your Persona is also really annoying, it's not hard because you just have to unsummon a persona and resummon it from the registry over and over but the process is really long and boring, even with the Persona that give the most points.\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nIf you have played and enjoyed Persona 5, go for it without thinking, except if you hate action-rpg. You'll have a blast.\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, i'd say to play it first because in Strikers they don't introduce the characters that are from regular P5, they assume you already know them. Also they reference some events that took place in P5.\n\n[h1]Any plans for Persona 3 FES and Persona 5 Royal atlus ?[/h1]",

        "content": "Despite being a much shorter game than your typical Persona game, Strikers still manages to tell a very compelling story that allows for characters to shine and really let their personalities steal the show. Once I started playing, I'll admit a part of me wasn't totally sold on the concept as a whole yet. I had never played a Musuo/Dynasty Warriors game before but knew that I had to see what the next chapter for the Phantom Thieves had in store for us. Sure enough, the further I progressed, the more the game grew on me and the more I bought into the transition Persona 5 went through to become a game like this. In reality, the essence of what makes Persona 5 such a compelling and lovable game was really what shined through in the end. The cast was full of life, love, fantastic personalities and unforgettable moments. Every character had moments that really let them take center stage and remind us all of what it means to overcome our own struggles and once again stand up on our own two feet. Personally, I wan't to give a special shout out to Haru, who was the final character to join the team in Persona 5. One of the things I wished we had in P5 was more time to spend with Haru and more opportunities for her to shine and that is exactly was Strikers gives us. This goes for all characters as well. I enjoyed getting to tag along with the Phantom Thieves for another journey through the human heart that resulted in some strong and powerful character moments that empowered the story to really hit home for myself and I'm sure for plenty of people, especially after everything we've been through and are still going through with COVID. It's crazy to think how towards the beginning of the pandemic we were graced with Persona 5 Royal and now a year later, we're given a worthwhile next chapter for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. A few things to touch on before wrapping this up.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe entire Persona series is known for its exceptional soundtracks and Strikers is no slouch in that department. Whether its the remixes of classic P5 tunes or the newcomers to the party making you stop what you're doing and groove in your chair, this game has no shortage of tunes for all manor of situations to aid you in your Phantom Thief duties! I plan on adding this soundtrack to my collection of Persona tunes that I already listen to on a daily basis.\n\n[h1] Crashes [/h1]\nThroughout my roughly 45 hours of game time, I had 3 total crashes happen while playing on PC. Thankfully, none of these crashes happened at crucial moments but it is something I've seen people write about in other reviews so make sure to save as often as possible!\n\n[h1] Story Continuation from Persona 5 [/h1]\nWhile ultimately not super important for the overall story, this game definitely assumes that you have played P5 before and are familiar with it's story so be mindful if you haven't played P5 before and are considering getting this game!\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nAny opportunity to team back up with the Phantom Thieves is easily one worth taking and Strikers does a great job delivering on a worthy sequel to what was already my favorite game of all time. Hopefully the overwhelming amount of positive feedback will encourage Atlus to keep releasing Persona games on steam since its clear that the Phandom, old and new, are eager for more! P5 fans will adore this game but ultimately, any fans of good storytelling and meaningful character development will fall in love just as easily! Thanks for everything, Phantom Thieves <3",

        "content": "It's quite excellent.\n\nIf you really enjoyed Persona 5, you probably already picked this up.  If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the 2nd Persona game to make it onto the Steam store and is the sequel to Persona 5.  It brings with it a compelling story, engaging combat and amazing music.  While technically a musou game, the game plays very much like a Persona game in most respects.  The majority of this review compares the differences between this game and Persona 5 and Musou games to give you a good sense of what you are getting yourself into.  \n\n[h1] Whats Changed [/h1]\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nCombat is by far the biggest difference between Persona 5 in this game.  The Combat has changed from a Turn Based System to an Active Time System, though it executes this spectacularly.  All of the iconic features of Persona are still present in this new combat system such as Weakness exploitation, All Out Attacks, and Stat/Ailment effects.  You also initiate combat just like you would in any other Persona game, by attacking an enemy on the field which sends you into a real time battle on the map.  \n\nWhile this is labeled as a Musou game, the only thing it really has in common with them is the number of enemies present on the screen usually consisting of a large number of trash mobs and a few enemies that actually pose a threat.  In addition, since it is Real Time, enemy attacks are now telegraphed and nearly all attacks are preventable by dodging out of the way or interrupting the enemy.  While this might be a bit hard to execute in trash mob fights with tons of enemies, this really shines in boss fights where there is one major threat to focus on.  \n\nOverall, this new Combat System is intertwined excellently with the Persona series, making you wonder why they have never done this before.  \n\n[b] Confidant System [/b]\n\nThe next big difference between this game and Persona 5 is the Confidant System, which was replaced with Bond Levels.  Unfortunately, this new system is quite limited as a whole, as it comprises only of party member interaction and lacks any NPCs to interact with and gain confidant levels with.  In addition, the time management system is all but gone as a result.  However, this new system still allows you to gain the benefits of the Confidant System by giving you Bond Exp with interactions, which you can use to buy perks very similar to what you would gain from Confidants.  \n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n \n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThe story is compelling as ever and while not quite as good as the main Persona series, still holds its own quite well, especially for a Musou game which typically don't have great stories. \n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nThe Music remains a strong point of the game and the series as a whole, with a number of remixed pieces from Persona 5 as well as plenty of new additions.  \n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] Crashes [/b]\n\nIn 50 hours of this game, I've had the game crash 5 times.  Each of these crashes occurred at either entering or exiting a dungeon, so often not much progress was lost.  However, since this game does not auto save, you have to be careful to save often to prevent losing significant progress.  \n\n[b] Lack of Prequel Explanation [/b] \n\nThis game absolutely expects you to have played Persona 5 prior to playing this game, as there is little explanation of character's backstories or prior events.  Often times, the game references major plot points of the previous game but does nothing to even mention what happened, leaving people who haven't played the previous game confused.  While normally not too much of a problem, it is not even possible to play Persona 5 on Steam as of this review.  \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is an extremely strong spinoff of Persona 5 with compelling gameplay and story.  However, it lacks some of the major features that some Persona fans love so much and also requires you to have played the first game in order to properly enjoy the story.",

True, it's different than regular persona games, but still the same.\nit got some features that actually even better than what's in regular persona game, u will miss some stuff, but u will enjoy what's in here.\nthe game is 50~70 hours depending on how u want to play the game, side quest isn't bad at all.\nthe story itself is really interesting and pretty solid.\n\noverall rating? dunno, but it's above 8/10",

There's no real character or moral development from Persona 5, just more of the same. Our main heroes act like they've never had any life experiences outside of what the game shows you, as if they're just actors in a show. Regardless, the game is fun, I just find myself cringing at the rather second-rate plot points and superficial character development.\n\nEDIT: After completing the game, and likely going on to 100% it, I'll change my review to recommend. The writing and storytelling is still quite sub-par, but the gameplay is still exponentially fun, even as a musou-style.",

        "content": "Let me first say: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED YET PERSONA 5 OR PERSONA 5 ROYAL, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, THIS IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO THOSE GAMES. \nIt\u00b4s very hard for me to make a objectively review of this game because Persona 5 Royal is my N\u00b0 1 favorite game of all time. When I first listened that we were going to have a new Persona experience with a new battle system which replace the turn based combat, it was really exciting news, but I also thought that it was going to be just a musou/warriors game with a persona art style, and hoo boy how I was wrong about that assumption.\n From the music to the art style,  and to the story and the combat, it really felt like a Persona 5 game. The implementation of some of the previous games combat system mechanics to this new musou/warriors style combat fitted perfectly. Each of the phantom thieves combat skills are unique and different from each other. About the music, they never cease to amaze me. Each of the music tracks are phenomenal and outstanding. If they release a Persona 5 Farming Simulation game with new music like this and the previous games, I\u00b4ll keep giving them my money.\n The visual novel story part is still in this game and very well adapted, and although the social link aspect of the previous game is replaced with this new bond level system, I think it adapts really well to the format of this game. The story and new characters in my opinion are very well written, and it is really easy to attach to them, as usual.\n If I had to criticize something, perhaps it would be that some of the characters from the previous game are not in this one, either way, the main roaster is here. \nTo conclude, if you have previously played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, definitely you have to play this game without any doubt. I repeat, if you have not played those games, then go play them first. THIS IS A SEQUEL. Let\u00b4s pray that Atlus release Persona 5 Royal and the other Persona games on Steam soon.\nLooking cool Joker.",

If you liked Persona 5, you'll like this too because it's essentially more P5. Stylish, fun team interactions, great music, a decent story (especially for a spin-off), and just the all-around polish that I've come to expect. My main takeaway from this and the fact that the SMT Nocturne Remaster is coming to Steam (announced yesterday as of writing this) is that Atlus is on PC to stay, and that's what I really love about this. These games coming to PC means that P4G made them realize they can print money by giving games to people on the platform they want, and I'm all for it.",

        "content": "the games uhhhhh, fine? but not worth the price at all if you cut out padding.\ni'd describe it as one of those DBZ games, where its kinda garbage but theres enough there to satisfy you.\n\nthey tried to do more than just Persona 5 Warriors and it works out on a surface level, but when you get down to the nitty gritty aspects of the game it feels stretched out extremely far and much less inspired (in some points just being unfinished too)\n\nSPOILERS:\n[spoiler]The 2nd \"Jail\" is a parody of lazy writing in fiction, the problem is thats all it is, theres no story to it other than a single joke that runs its course 5 minutes into a several hour story arc.\n\nThe third Jail uses the exact same assets with an ice filter, and the aesthetic is tied to a really really really actually lazy story (so far, yet to complete it), so while the game is making fun of lazy tropey writing, it turns around and falls to that problem without realizing it.[/spoiler]\n\nThe combats genuinely very fun, but then the game forces itself into persona 5 mechanics and kneecaps itself due to it.\n\nFirst off, like persona 5 you \"ambush\" enemies and that starts the actual encounters and this is cool and allows for fast grinding later on, it also means theres a short cutscene and waiting period every time you try to start combat. It feels super bad to play, especially if you are trying to do the constant backtracking side missions which just require you grind X enemy in Y dungeon Z times.\n\nAgain from the original game, abilities use HP/SP but unlike the original game there isnt a ticking clock that makes you want to get as far through the palace as possible in one go. In strikers you can leave the dungeon at any checkpoint (which are very common) and instantly return with full stats. So unless you like fighting health spongey bosses with no stats youl be jumping in and out of dungeons often early on when you dont have many tools/items.\n\nTonnes of the game (especially the shibuya areas) feel fake, the attention to detail and things you can do are significantly limited, while this is understandable it just makes it feel strange to have 7 different shops next to each other that all sell 2 things when you have no real reason to actually touch them at all outside the cooking mechanic (which isnt a mechanic as much as a way to make a shitload of items quickly, if you bought ingredients earlier)\n\nIn the end the game just feels like the people making it liked persona 5 (and probably previous SMT games) but didnt really like the downtime aspects of persona 5, or had no idea how to implement it with the road trip aesthetic.\n\nI really wish it was just a lazy Persona 5 Warriors game, because im having fun in extremely quick bursts followed by worse handholding than original p5.",

It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay.\n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime.",

Seeing the Phantom Thieves hanging out and having fun in different locales is a treat.\n- The UI is still as stylish as ever. \n- Music is awesome and varied. The new rock-infused tracks fit right in with the jazz music from the original game.\n- Sophia and Zenkichi are great additions to the cast, both having great characterizations and deep and complex backstories.\n- Gameplay is action-packed and hectic. Puts a spin in the typical Musou-formula. Each character have their own unique fighting styles, allowing for different experiences.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b] \n- The gameplay is rather repetitive. You'll be mowing down enemies again, again and again with no signs of stopping. \n- Bossfights are tedious and will test your patience. It will take quite a while to whittle down a boss's health to even half-health. Even mini-bosses aren't exempt from this. \n- Crashes and long loading times happen but are rare. Save often to prevent loss of progress.\n\nAll-in-all, as a Persona 5 fan, I love the game and enjoyed most of it. Love the story, the interactions between the crew, and the new characters. The gameplay is fun enough, although I'm not the biggest fan of it.\n",

Game crashed a couple times (only at cutscene transitions) but it was rare and I believe these have been fixed with the recent beta hotfix, along with problems other players were having when the game launched such as the major \"black screen\" bug I've heard. Luckily I never was hit with it or any other major bugs. I think in my opinion Atlus did a great job with the release of Persona 5 Strikers on Steam.\n\nI 100%'d Persona 4 Golden a little before this came out early. And a little while ago I 100%'d this.\n\nNow we just need a Persona 5 Royal port so I don't have to deal with the inferior version on a console released almost a decade and a half ago, I already have over 400 hours on a New Game+ save on it anyways.\n\nI can't wait to try out the SMT III: Nocturne remaster once I get the chance to.",

        "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Persona 5 fan, having played the base game several times and Royal twice. I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100",

        "content": "i haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time\n\ni was skeptical about the game when it was first announced - it seemed flashy and energetic, but i wasnt sure how the game could marry musou combat and a megaten fusion/affinity system together\nbut i was wrong lol\ngameplay is exciting and oozes the persona 5 flourish, while never feeling too visually overwhelming\ni was surprised to find that the general musou focus on slaughtering thousands of enemies isn't super potent here - there are moments of cathartic release where you can wail on waves and waves of shadows, but strikers does a great job of giving you more complex fights with interesting minibosses\neach fighter has something interesting to offer mechanically, which makes it more fun to switch out your party members - even characters i dont like as written are fun to mess around with in dungeons\nthe game isn't incredibly strong narratively, but there are plenty of good character moments over the course of the story to keep you invested - though some may be predictable to those already familiar with neo-persona\nthe new music tracks fit the game well, and the dlc legacy music pack is a welcome addition. getting the innocent sin music to play during fights pumps dopamine directly into my brainstem\n\nthe camera can sometimes be a bit of a pain - not enough to knock points, but something to note\nit's most notable in certain boss fights, where the enemy is moving very quickly around the stage and the camera has a hard time following them around if you're trying to lock on\nsome enemies are also a bit spongier than they really need to be - certain bosses make sense, but some fights feel like they go on longer than they deserve to, and become less a test of skill and more a test of endurance\n\nthat said it's an incredibly solid game\ni hope this pc port sells well - i'd love to see atlus be more willing to port their games over to more platforms\nplenty of games like digital devil saga 1&2, the persona 2 duology, and especially ronde deserve to be experienced by a modern audience",

        "content": "I knew from the start I was going to be writing this review since I normally do so when a certain game piques my interest or is somehow important to me (or in this case, additionally, to beg for Persona 5 Royal and Catherine Full Body on Steam since I would gladly buy them both at full price and I'd be a very happy camper given the opportunity). Well here I am, 94 hours, 47 achievements and fifteen crashes later and I have my thoughts all together. What they're telling me, however, seems to be that I am disappointed with this game since it has the nerve to carry the name of Persona 5 yet Persona 5 Strikers is not even in the same league as Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Good news is that means that it isn't better or much better than a 4/5 (where P5/P5R are perfect and mere mortal arithmetic cannot measure how awesome they are and I will carry them to the grave as the best gaming experience [or even experience period] that I have ever had), which is still good and why I leave it as recommended.\n\nI end up wondering why people have it in them to say it's at all a \"sequel to Persona 5\" when the gameplay of Persona is so far different from that of Persona 5 Strikers. I understand that we have the same characters go on a new adventure the summer following Joker's leave in spring, but fundamentally, the game is different; it's more of the fruit and less of the vine. Since it is as such, the game cannot be recommended to those who have not first played Persona 5 in my books and I would quickly tell them to take their hands off the wallet and I would direct them to the nearest police station and have them arrested for not playing Persona 5 as of yet.\n\nOn the other hand, for those who have played Persona 5, I do recommend it, but I cannot say just that. I also recommend checking out Persona 5 Royal. Yes, it's the same game, but it is so well built upon and improved that it often feels more worth the sixty dollars than Strikers even if you already played Persona 5. I played just over 200 hours of Persona 5 in 2018 and I still had it in me to play for over 300 when I got my hands on Royal two years later. Royal has seriously brought so much more to the table, including an actual reason to make your high-end personas shine since there are a few more end game fights that you can really put them to the test with (I say that specifically because while having S****ael in your roster is all well and good, using other personas like Vishnu, Mada, Odin, and others just didn't happen once you had him, but the fights in Royal seem to give me enough of a reason to max out the stats on 13 separate personas and I enjoyed it very much). But this isn't a Royal review, I am just putting it out there that if you own a PS4/PS5, you still have options to be considered.\n\nIf you have your sights set on Stikers, however, then I won't say your making the wrong choice since it is pretty decent game even taking the bad into account.\n\nTo start, the story was highly predictable. If you are reading this paragraph (i.e. you played Persona 5), you should have a pretty good idea of where the story is going and how far you are in it at anywhere past the fourth Jail. I had a pretty good idea and I was mostly right. I was also turned off especially by the overused ideas and themes I had heard so many times before; it felt unoriginal and I found myself yawning through a lot of dialogue.\n\nThe combat was there, but just not really to my preference. You know how it goes. I simply prefer the turn-based combat of the original (shockingly, since I don't like that kind of stuff in pretty much any instance other than Persona). It still had its perks, like spamming Morning Star until the game slows down to a crawl and my PC decides it is actually a Boeing 747 and it's scheduled for flight at this time. Things like that aren't possible when it's turn-based.\n\nThe controls were good if you are using a controller. Otherwise, and I may just be too dumb for KBaM, it's horrible. All I'm saying is: if someone put a gun to my head and told me to play Persona 5 Strikers using keyboard controls... You get the gist of it; someone is on brain-cleaning duty.\n\nFinally, the crashes and infinite loading screens: I had fifteen and one respectively and they were a bit of a downcast on my playtime. The crashes happen (in my experience) only during loading screens and I often saw these loading screens as hazardous areas at times especially after defeating a boss and having extended periods of storytelling before the next save point. I don't count them against the game by much since I know the developers are looking into these issues and I have faith that it won't be long before they are fixed.\n\nOverall, it's a good game and I enjoyed my time playing it. I just have reasons to say save your money or spend it elsewhere. Supposing you are like me, however, then you have either already bought the game or you have made plans to buy it as soon as humanly possible and are here reading this review just to pass the time.\n\n4/5. Bring Royal to Steam.\n\nAnd Full Body.\n\nPlease and thank you.",

So you will need to have played that to understand what is going on. \nStory wise, it is not as good as the original, but it definitely has its moments, and I think its a good sequel that doesn't feel forced.\nAs far as the combat, at first it can feel really off putting because of the Dynasty Warriors style, to remedy this, you can bump up the difficulty to hard. the mini bosses and bosses are actually pretty fun this way and the gameplay elements blend together pretty well.\nDefinitely give this a try if you enjoyed the original Persona 5. it is well worth it.",

This is more of an action-rpg sequel than a musou spin-off, and it is a REALLY good one at that!  I would recommend this to ANYONE who liked Persona 5 at all.\n\nThis is WAY more than a spin-off.",

The gameplay style change fits so well, the story and the Phantom Thieves were just as great as the first one (maybe even better), the two new characters were written so well and I still listen to the soundtrack and probably will for a long time.\n\nHonestly this game is the perfect sequel for me.

        "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5",

        "content": "Okay, so for a PC port this was really good. \nMy only problem with the game itself: \nThe one major problem I had was the game randomly crashing, which was a rare occurrence ( happened only like 2-3 times in the 60+ hours i've played) so as long as you've saved regularly, it shouldn't be a problem. What I can't quite figure out is why it crashed? One of the times it happened I was just walking from one area of the real world to another, it wasn't even if a particularly crowded area with a lot of NPC's. The first time it happened it happened during a dialogue scene (the one in the attic towards the start of the game), which should be even less likely because it wasn't even loading anything at the time. Of course, I am hyping this up to be more of a problem then it actual is, and there is a chance that it may just be something my computer is doing. \n\nstory wise:\nHonestly, I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. This is a sequel game, if you played the original, you'll like this one, if you haven't you'd probably find a lot of the character beats uninteresting. The sole exception to that is the two new thieves, one of which is just adorable and the other of which is one of the funniest characters in any video games I have ever played.  Also, keep in mind that this game is a lot shorter then the original, which to be fair was a long game, but even beyond time spent, the first couple of dungeons were fillery, not bad, just not particularly important. I still had fun with it though.\n\nGame play:\nNo, it is not turn based, and yes the new combat can take a little bit to get used to, but its fun in its own way and I really enjoyed it and it makes this game feel like its own distinct thing and not just Persona 5 expect smaller and a tacked on story.",

        "content": "While this is a longer review, this does not talk much about any combat/spoilers present in the game. This is instead a look at the game from a series perspective, so there may be other reviews more suited to your taste if this is not what you're looking for. I am not including a TL:DR because the review is a little scatterbrained despite it's length. If this helps even one person then I'm glad.\n\nIn many ways, Persona 5 Strikers is like a sequel to Persona 5. This isn't an original statement, as many describe the game this way, but the fact that it can be described as a sequel speaks volumes for one simple reason: P5S is just a spinoff. Atlus, along with the other studio that helped produced this work, were so bold as to mix ideas from the long-standing Persona/SMT with combat likened to Nier:Automata and Devil May Cry. It's very well done; the aesthetic that makes 5 stand out is still present here, and it is very faithful to the original game. I wouldn't say that it follows up perfectly after the release of Persona 5 Royal, (because this game released in Japan about a month before Royal went worldwide) so don't expect any of the characters/content from Royal here. I will say that a lot of the ideas for Royal were taken from this game, such as the thought process behind the Showtime! mechanic, so if you're familiar with some of the more recognizable content they added in Royal which was not present in the base Persona 5, you'll be glad to find it here. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers does contain some slight spoilers for Persona 5, so be warned if you haven't experienced 5 that there may be some things that are present here which could surprise you. I want to mention one key aspect that this game made me constantly think about though: the only thing holding Persona 5 Strikers, a SPINOFF title, from feeling like a main series game, was the lack of any confidant/social link mechanic. While this is disappointing, the fact that this can even be considered a downside should speak volumes for the game itself. There are only two instances in the game where any activity related to hanging out with a friend from the confidant/social link mechanics in other Persona games exist here. However, it should be considered greatly that following the events from Persona 5, you should not even need a confidant/social link bond with the characters in this game, considering that aside from the two new additions, you've already met and experienced hardship as well as friendship with every other character as the Phantom Thieves. \n\nAnother major advantage this game has is replayability and content. In your first playthrough, if you are even just a little adventurous, you will likely fuse most of the personas and have done just about all of the unique mini bosses present. Although, unlike in base 5 and Royal, the hardest difficulty for this game is locked behind a first completion of the game and then the completion of the post-game content. Let me say that if you're like me, and want a challenge from a game, the hard difficulty from a generic playthrough provides more difficulty than Persona 5/Royal's hardest difficulty. The hardest difficulty in this game is much, much more difficult than that. So trust me when I say that this game has enough content and replayability value, especially for those who want the challenge and unique achievements you can only gain through a merciless NG+ run. \n\nAs a final statement for this review, which has been all over the place, there is one more thing I want to mention. Fans of Persona 5 love the game for a lot of reasons; it's not a huge stretch to say it's a masterpiece in it's very flooded genre, which happens to be one of my favorite game genres. In my (and many others) experience, the music for Persona 5 is the one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am especially happy to say that the new music found in Persona 5 Strikers, be it the new battle themes and remixes of old battle themes or the background/tone setting music, is fan-fu**in-tastic. My personal favorite songs are \"Crossover\" and \"Counter Strike\", so be sure to check them out if you love the music but aren't sure about getting the game. Thanks to anyone who happened to read through this, and sorry for not having a TL:DR. If this helps even one person make the decision either to or not to buy the game, then that is enough for me. Let's hope for more PC releases and ports for this series and SMT!",

I have actually never played P5 before, so I will wonder if I will be able to follow all of the elements of story well enough.  So far, so good.\n\nI do hate that you now HAVE to be online to play the game.  I know, it isn't that big of a deal, but it is a restriction I can't stand.  I guess that is the Denuvo talking.  If having to go online just to play a single player game is a deal breaker, I would suggest moving on from this.  \n\nOther than that, if you like Musou or want more Persona 5 content, this is a great addition with great gameplay and an excellent soundtrack.",

I have always been a fan of Turn Based games but Hack and Slash represents the nature of the Phantom Thieves. Sneaky and hard to spot but extremely powerful and quick during combat. Hack and Slash genre truly fits the Phantom Thieves and Persona in general.",

That battle system and the amazing soundtracks combined make battles a lot more fun and addicting to play.\nAlso the game runs smoothly, 60 fps and well animated character models makes it pleasant to the eyes, ALTHOUGH I have experienced a lot of random crashes during loading times, making hours of playtime go to waste because there is no auto save feature which can make you pissed off.\nThis game is a solid recommendation to the people who enjoyed P5 and P5 Royal and want to see more of the Phantom Thieves.",

        "content": "If you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona you enjoy the game. I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything. And frame rate randomly drops. I have a 3090 playing between 1080p and 1440p.",

        "content": "In terms of writing, its one of the best Persona spin-offs \n\nThis feels like a genuine sequel to Persona 5 with Characters feeling exactly as they did in Persona 5. Which sounds obvious. but considering how in Persona Q characters were overly simplified with beloved characters like Chie/Akihiko hyperfixating on Meat/Protein its a massive improvement. The new characters are fun and interesting. Zangetshi the cop character is a especially fun character. Sophie can be kinda annoyingly roboty at points, sometimes stopping the story to ask about complicated emotions. which my dumbass usually ends up telling her \"uh yeah the human heart is a complicated thing or whatever lets get back to the story.\" but shes also a really fun character. \n\nNow in terms of gameplay its a dynasty warriors game with platforming, which is what interested me, i've played games like hyrule warriors and felt the terrains were incredibly flat with a shitload of enemies to beat the shit out of. i figured the platforming would change it up a bit to allow more verticality. Which to the game's benefit. it does and its fun as hell to zip around the cities jumping from rooftop to rooftop or jumping off cars in the street. \n\nMy problems are the actual battles, you either have random encounters that last 5 seconds or bosses that have \"Weakness shields.\" And if you didn't bring the right characters to help you destroy the weakness shields you're gonna be blowing all your MP with joker in order to deal any significant amount of damage to the enemy. Plus bosses are easily stun locked if you just spam the same attack over and over again. Which makes me wonder if it would've been good if they went the ff7R route and gave you a turn bar or something. \nif you get low at all you can just pause the game and quickly heal up. and considering how easy it is to stock up on healing items. especially if you're constantly checking Sophie's shop for those discounted healing items. you may as well just so Joker is carrying less weight. \nOh uh, you can also play as all the other phantom thieves and they all have their own movesets and theyre all fun to play.\nIts just some are more fun to play then others. Joker, Yusuke and Haru are the most fun for me Personally. Mostly because for some reason a lot of the characters either have attacks that leave you vulnerable for just a second too long. Makoto. Or characters with attacks so pathetically weak that theyre almost not worth playing. Morgana. Or characters with Gimmicks that don't feel fun. Ryuji. Yusuke has that fun counter mechanic, and i like holding down a button and watching Haru fuck stuff up. \n\nAnyhow, i've been enjoying my time with this game. I think its one of the better persona spin-offs. mostly because its not a dancing game. \n\nStory is good, \nCharacters are great,\nGameplay kinda sucks when its just you constantly going into your persona menu pressing the enemy's weakness spell and then rinsing and repeating. but when you're destroying groups of shadows its really fun. weirdly enough its the hacking sections that are the most fun. because its just you protecting futaba from trash mobs while she does her thing. \n\nyeah i'd say its worth a buy if you liked Persona 5 and need more of the characters.",

I personally couldn't care less that it was released for Steam since I was gonna play it on PlayStation to begin with, and the Switch version is inferior in many ways. Excellent game if you played persona 5 or 5 royal, if you havent then it drops to a good game. Then again If you played 5 or 5 royal you have a ps4, and should just use that for Strikers/the dancing games if you lack a PS Vita. Apparently this game crashes in some parts according to acquaintances, but I don't plan to stick around to find out if that happens to me. Give me something else to buy, ATLUS. I could throw you some money for Nocturne",

I would genuinely be fine with more of these going forward.\n\ncharacters were well written, old characters get more depth and new characters are great, even those with little screen time.\n\nThere are a decent variety of Personas, not as many as in the main game but that\u2019s to be expected and never feels lacking.\n\nI do have a personal gripe however, one contains spoilers for Persona 5: Royal and one does not.\n\nnon spoiler: Why is Joker\u2019s trauma never explored in this? it would make for great character depth, I know I know protag for people to put themselves onto, but what about the interrogation room? being responsible for the thieves? more? these things are traumatic and deserve to be explored\n\nSpoilers now so continue to read at your own risk \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey Atlus! So! why\u2019d you take Akechi\u2019s backstory, traumas, and aesthetic and give them to anime tony stark instead of just including Akechi!\n\nThe end of P5R shows he lives.

The soundtrack is incredible, the story felt more impactful and it got me so hooked ever since the 4th jail. The ending was beautiful and the graphics were just stunning at times. It makes me so happy to see how far persona has come and it is by far my favorite game series. This game is worth the 60 dollars completely. I wouldn't even hesitate  to play it again.

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers gives us a completely new experience from the developer's past games.[/h1]\n\n48 hours and one game clear later, I [b]finally[/b] feel qualified to write a review.\nI walked into Persona 5 Strikers thinking it was [b][i]yet another musou game.[/i][/b] I have never been so wrong about a video game in my entire life.\n\n[h1][b]Omega Force[/b] changed the traditional [i]\"Clear this area, go to outpost A, defeat enemy B\" [/i]and crafted a new experience that made sure the game [i]remained[/i] a [b]Persona[/b] game before it is a [b]musou [/b]game.[/h1]\n\nThe combination of both a captivating story and involved button mashing combat (it makes sense if you think really hard about it) results in the [b][i]ENTIRE[/i][/b] Persona 5 Strikers experience.\nI honestly thought I was going to open up this game and be put in a menu-based system where I had to select my destination to move from point A to point B. I didn't expect a well-written story, or lengthy, enjoyable cutscenes, and map areas that were more than just [i]\"Go[/i][b][i] [/i][/b][i]here! Your ally is being attacked! Help x! Don't let y fall!\"[/i]\nIf you look at all of the past musou games, they are all the same copy and pasted formula. Same map layouts, different textures and models. The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it. We are granted an enhanced combat system that allows usage of Personas, Ambushes, and Phantom Dashes. The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.\n\n[h1]The game is more of an Action RPG than it is a musou.[/h1]\n\nThe story is incredible. The characters are incredible. The music is incredible.\nWe are allowed time outside of jails to do.. [i]Persona[/i] things. Our Personas level up, we play with their skills and passives, and we continue on.\nThe request system grants us access to new challenges that give us items and xp. Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

        "content": "To be honest; this is a weird one.\n\nYou get in this game thinking it is a musou game; so what you do is to mow hordes of generic enemies, and the occasional elite. Not in this game. \n\nI found myself confused at what this game want to be, and while I recommend this game; I can say that it is not what I was expecting, even after playing the demo. \n\nThe good: it is P5, including all the tropes you already know if you played the P5 or other persona games; but the combat is fundamentally what change things around. In P5 you have turn based combat; you need to be stealthy and can be very strategic; to the point where each game session take hours to go through; because the game is fundamentally a RPG.\n\nHere you have a similar approach; but the combat is a 1 vs many as in other musou games. This would not be bad if the game was allowing you to roam around and just decimate the ton of generic enemies like in other dinasty warriors games; but here you can't do that. First because your health and SP are ridiculously low; so playing a musou game like a musou game would end up in quick game over. So you end up playing a game that is like a light version of P5 and with real time combat instead of the turn based. It is weird, and you can see it once you start to play the game.\n\nThe demo does not show you that aspect of the game; so if you play the demo, be ready for P5S to be different from the demo. What bother me the most is the long amount of time needed to play each stage; you need to play this game not like a musou game, and that is what I don't really like.\n\nAlso the game is very confusing with the UI and all effects going on. With P5 it is ok because you are in a turn based flow; no need to move the camera, no need to press buttons together to execute a special attack; so the flair of the artistic choices in the UI are welcome.\n\nHere it is a mess; while you try to make a combo; can't see what is going on, and if an enemy is ready for the \"pile up\" attack you do with the B button; you can't see it unless you rotate the camera constantly to be aware of your surroundings. The combat itself is fast paced and mid tier enemies can mess you up fast, if you don't pay attention. Not sure if it is the angle, the field of view or what else, but this game does not play as well as a dinasty warrior game for sure; so getting a feel for what is going on is really hard.\n\nOther than that, I enjoy the game overall; but if I would know that this game is more like P5 with real time combat and less dinasty warriors, I would probably wait for a sale, instead of buying it at full price.\n\n7 out of 10 for me; lots of hours to sink in; if you can put up with the difficulty and the flashy UI during combat",

Fast forward to now and I can honestly woke me up to P5's overall story. I love this game's feel. I had so much fun just hanging out with everyone in game, I also have now found my favorite character in the Persona series. Zenkichi and Sophia are treasures. Will say this to those who are thinking of getting into the series. This is cannon to vanilla Persona 5 and not Royal so keep that in mind. \nNow if only Atlus would port over Persona 3 and 5 over.

Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n",

It isn't tedious or boring like Warriors games, because it sends you on an adventure that fits the Phantom Thieves well. They went the extra mile even by allowing the protagonist to use multiple Personas instead of just giving him Arsene. Every Persona is even given combo attacks. Last thing to say is I hope they bring Persona 5 Royal to PC",

        "content": "This is an excellent continuation of Persona 5.  As a spin-off product, it's difficult to recommend as a standalone title without having played Persona 5 before.  And if you much prefer turn based RPGs to action combat, I would pass on this.  But if you clear those hurdles, you'll find a fun game with enjoyable characters and stylish fights.\n\nRather than overly extol praise about all the great things, this format is easier:  Everything about this game is top notch, except\n\n-There are some crash to desktop issues when leaving dungeons.  I recommend saving at every checkpoint, every time, so you won't lose much progress.\n-Given the nature of the battles, sometimes it can be tricky to keep track of all potential threats as you dash about.  Sometimes you can get hit with a nasty attack from off-screen without warning, and that makes you feel like a very un-stylish phantom thief.  Same goes for when you get knocked down during a cool combo.  Desperately waggling a joystick isn't a terribly fun mechanic.\n-Most of the side quests feel a bit boring, and have you repeatedly backtracking old dungeons.  Thankfully, the checkpoints are many, and the objectives are fairly reasonable.\n\nAnd that's my review.  Buy this game, be a Japanese teen, and beat up god(s) with the power of friendship.  Then go to bed because your cat said so.  Great value.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers feels like a full-fledged sequel to Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. By no means is it a cheap spinoff. That said, while I'm sure the game can be enjoyed and understood without playing Persona 5/Royal, I highly recommend either watching a playthrough of Royal, emulating the base Persona 5 (making sure to buy your own copy of the game and ripping it yourself instead of other means, of course!) or if you have a PS4, playing Royal. \n\nStrikers is a 30-40 hour return with the familiar party members of Persona 5, with some new faces, and a new plot. Once again, Atlus outdid themselves in making the party feel like a tight-knit group of friends, and even gave some much needed character development to those left hanging from the original. (looking at you, Haru, Ann, and Yusuke)\n\nPersonally, the shift to a Dynasty Warriors type real-time combat system is... fine. It doesn't do anything special for me, and honestly with most boss/miniboss fights it just devolves into spamming the same couple skills until you can't anymore. That said, the translation from a turn-based JRPG to real-time action was done very well, I just personally would prefer the incredible innovations on the turn-based JRPG formula that the original games provided.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game is sublime. Much like Persona 5 itself, the game just bleeds style, on everything from the animations to the menu UI. The music is also just exceptional, especially since it takes some of the best tracks from Persona 5 and gives them some new, almost metal, life.\n\nI did have some issues with random crashes between loads (running an i9-9900k and a 1070ti for reference), so make sure you save often, but they maybe happened four or five times in my fourty or so hours, and would in no way detract from the shining recommendation that I can give for this game.\n\nMakoto best girl",

        "content": "Bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam! Okay, now that that obligation is done, here's an actual review.\n\nDisclaimer: At time of writing, this game has weird issues on PC. You should play in either borderless window or windowed mode in general to reduce load times. I had this installed on an SSD and when it ran in full screen it took a solid 30 seconds to a minute to load while in the bordered modes took about 5 seconds. Not to mention if you do play fullscreen you'll frequently get stuck in loading screens. This occurred when playing in windowed for me a few times as well so it's still a toss-up if you lose progress or not. Unfortunately, this happened most frequently after big boss fights for me and was very frustrating. Running in administrator mode seems to help with these issues as well but this game really needs some patches.\n\nStrikers was a surprise. I happened to be finish Royal the day that Strikers released and was eager to return to the world of Persona 5. As much as I find that Musou are not to my taste, this game really hit the right nerve. It tries to adapt the strengths of Persona to a Musou format and achieves this fairly well. It's still a button masher but each character controls differently from one another and being able to swap between 4 party members on the fly is a nice feature. The game is just as stylistic and flashy as the original P5 with a hard-rock twist to the original's already amazing soundtrack.\n\nThe story itself is fairly lighthearted especially compared to P5 and Royal. Strikers is a road trip video game which is something we don't see often and made me immediately fall in love with this tone. The characters are generally having more fun and surprisingly the English voice acting for Strikers might be better than P5 or Royal. Characters feel more expressive and emotive and I laughed a lot more at this game than the previous entry. The story does go towards a direction I didn't like at the end by retreading themes you've seen before but overall, I did enjoy it even if it is entirely unnecessary.\n\nOverall, a fun time and a worthwhile, albeit unnecessary, follow-up to Persona 5. If you can deal with the issues I mentioned and are looking for a charming and lighter return to the Phantom Thieves, this road trip across Japan is a solid recommendation.",

        "content": "Boy howdy, these Musou Games are getting pretty sophisticated. This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.",

Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!",

        "content": " Pretty great game, and a great Persona title at that. A lot of mechanics that found in other Persona games are nonexistent in Strikers, most notably Social Links. Instead, you travel through Japan and go through the most well known cities to fight off jails instead of palaces. The graphics are great, and with 60 FPS and 4K support, Persona has never looked so good. The music is top notch and is the same level of quality from Persona 5, with a few tracks in Strikers being my favorite in the Persona series. The story is pretty good along with the writing, although a bit cheesy and full of anime tropes. \n\n The combat is the biggest difference obviously, and fitting the SMT mechanics with Action RPG works really well. While bosses are super tanky and take forever to kill without much variety, the combat overall is great with tons of mechanics that are unique. All-out attacks and 1 Mores exist, and with each character having a different move set, there are a lot of ways to go into a fight. The glaring issue I have though are the bosses. I found they took way to many hits to take out. On top of that, you must buy food and medicine any chance you get. I bought anything I could and made any food that could provide me SP, and the final fight still took away all of my SP food in the end that I was saving up. Personas this time around are lacking in numbers, so even though you can combine and create new Personas, there's a serious downgrade compared to other Persona titles. Optimization is pretty alright, and even though some say they can hardly play the game with all of the crashing, I've only experienced it twice in my 40 hour playthrough.\n\n It's not Persona 5, but as a standalone title, Strikers does a good job at blending elements from Dynasty Warriors and Persona to bring a fun experience.",

        "content": "This game is fantastic. \n\nBefore I say anything else though I must state that this one isn't really for anyone that hasn't played either vanilla Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. This game is much more of a sequel story-wise than a spin-off, so there are countless references and parallels drawn to the original game, and all of which will fly over newcomers' heads or at least will not have the full impact. Hopefully a Steam port of Royal isn't too far off, but if you own a PS4, I recommend picking up Royal as it is also fantastic.\n\nNow, this game is the newest in the line of franchises to receive the Dynasty Warriors treatment, turning away from the turn-based combat the series is known for real-time action combat. I personally have never played a Dynasty Warriors game, but I have grown up playing a fair share of character-action games, so the style of combat isn't new to me. However, this isn't to say that nothing from Persona's combat system is present. In fact, there is a lot more than I was expecting. The ability to fuse multiple personas, the focus on enemy weaknesses and resistances, and technical and critical hits are still here. While each character has a number of combos they can perform, pulling out a persona freezes time and allows you to choose abilities to use mid combat much like you would in original. Of course, a good chunk of this has been streamlined a bit to balance and fit the real-time combat. The number of obtainable personas is significantly lower, and certain skills and ailments have either been reworked or cut. However, none of this retracts from the game, in my opinion, and combat is really fluid, and each character is unique and fun to use. The game does an excellent job of blending the Persona elements with the new style of combat.\n\nNext, the story is great. Though it does retread some old ground from the original, it is told really well and the voice cast really knocks it out of the park. It's fun to see this cast of characters interact with each other, and the new characters are great and well fleshed out. To note it for Persona fans, the social elements are not present here. You do not level up confidants or have to manage your daily schedule as this game is much more linear and shorter in its storytelling. Do not come into this game expecting the traditional Persona experience. \n\nLike Persona 5, this game's presentation is nothing short of brilliant. The UI elements and menus themselves are fluid and gorgeous to look at. On top of that, the dungeons and real world areas you visit are well designed and fun to explore. \n\nFor performance, I lucked out for the most part has I have not encountered any game breaking bugs or so that halted progress, though do note that plenty of others have reported infinite loading screen issues and the like. I did, however, experience numerous crashes throughout my playthrough. Luckily, I have it ingrained into my brain to save at every chance I get so no significant progress was ever lost, but do take note of this issue and remember to save every chance you get and there are plenty of chances to save in this game. No patch or update has been released to address these issues as of writing this.\n\nIn short, this game is fantastic. If you've played and enjoyed Persona 5, then this title is a must have. Just don't come into this one expecting the complete, traditional Persona experience.\n",

        "content": "(Dungeon 5 issue fix below. I'll update when I finish the game to give my proper thoughts. Thanks for the help everyone ^^)\n\nNote: Explanation second paragraph !!!!\n\nFirstly, I want to say I've had a great time playing Strikers! While the combat can get repetitive, you'll never get tired of activating showtime, partner swap, or an all-out attack! The story (What I've been able to play) started a bit slow however picks up with great emotional scenes, bad-ass set pieces, and boss fights. I've enjoyed my stay up until now..... \n\nWe started with a few minor crashes, but was not too serious and only happened 3 times in my 47hr playthrough. Now though I am locked out of any story progression when completing the 5th jail. I can challenge the boss with no issue and win. When I finish the cut-scene afterwards, however, I am locked into an infinite loading black screen. I've tried multiple things and done the fight roughly 5 times now. I'm on Hard difficulty completing all side tasks and collecting all possible persona's my playthrough. Why's this important? because as of now I can't complete the game, making all the work up to this stage pointless...... \n\nPlease send suggestions to the discussion I've posted for other approaches and PLEASE FIX ATLUS/SEGA!!! I love this series and it hurts me to give an enjoyable game a negative review but I think this is the only way I can get my message across.",

Take that exe and replace the one in your games directory, I would not go pirate this game without buying it first, because the more people who buy it shows atlus that there is a player base for persona and shin megami tensei on pc, which means hopefully more ports of atlus games coming to steam and pc. BUY THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT!!",

        "content": "I'll start by saying that I am an avid admirer of Persona 5 and it's story. For me, it was the first of the series that I bought and played on the recommendation of a close friend. I grew to love Persona 5 so much that I had ended up playing the game over and over, committing all I could to memory. I wanted to observe every nuance of what made Persona 5 the game it was, or rather is. I even bought the Persona 5 Royal version and fell in love all over again. When I first saw Persona 5 Strikers I immediately looked into it, like any fan would. The trailer video was encaptivating, but I hesitated to buy. The completely overhauled battle system worried me. The original Persona 5 battle system encompassed a long time familiar style of RPG turn-based battles most gamers of the genre are familiar with. Additionally, the time management aspect coupled with building confidants added an endearing allure. Strikers, a now hack & slash version, redesigned combat from the ground up. Personally, I avoid games like this because I recognize my lack of ability and commitment to build the skills necessary to dominate the battlefield. The realization that I may not enjoy this game disheartened me for the longest time. Many times I skipped passed Strikers in the Steam store. However, maybe due to overwhelming boredom, I began perusing the comments of players who had played the game. I can't remember the poster, but they shared the same concern as my own. After reading it, I decided that even if I didn't love the game, that I loved the Persona franchise so much that I'd support it regardless. On that note...\n\nUSE THE GAMEPAD CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME! Standard keyboard setup is not sufficient for this game.\n\nInitially, I disliked combat, and I disliked the feeling of having my Persona 5 world condensed into the shell of an \"efficient game\". What I mean is the play style and aspects of play seemed to have been developed in a way that screams \"instant satisfaction\". Not that it's a bad thing. It just seemed hollow in comparison to its predecessor. I was starting to feel a disconnect to the series. \"I guess they're just trying to monetize on the success of the story.\" The thought spoke loudly in my head. As I started to progress into the game, it was clear that my preconceived notions were wrong.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, albeit different from Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, is still an amazing game. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts still managed to steal this skeptical heart of mine. Though I find the battle system complex and difficult to use well, it still offers a new and fun perspective. If you've played Persona 5 or Royal, this game is guaranteed to throw you for a loop. But don't give up. If you're a true Phantom Thief, you'll rise to the challenge and steal the love for this game you once had. Give it a chance. You won't regret.",

The story is pretty good for a sequel, it held my interest for the whole time and had very relaxing times in between. The gameplay is of course not a turn based rpg, but instead a hack and slash. Which might sound not as hard, but trust me its very much as hard if not harder than persona 5's gameplay. In all honesty i love persona 5 and i paid full price for this game and almost 100% completed it at 71 hours in, its worth the money.",

        "content": "[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] Feel free to follow my review page![/url][/i] and my twitch https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg\n\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is an action hack&slash spin-off/sorta sequel for the fantastic rpg, Persona 5, which sadly has not been released on PC, a game that fans will surely love even in a different gameplay style. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d [u]The good parts:[/u]\n+The same characters you loved in P5 are back with all their great chemistry. \n+Initially combat seems a mess but as you get deeper into it, especially on Hard, it gets quite fun and challenging at times. \n+Most of the music from P5 is back but there are some nice new songs as well.\n+Boss fights.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n-You need to play Persona 5 on PS4 else it will be incredibly hard to follow.\n-The story presentation is almost the same as the original P5 but with a different coating. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nPersona 5 Strikers is in an odd spot for what it is. What I mean by that is, it does continue after the events of the original Persona 5 but the Royal version which is arguably much better is not canon in Strikers which puts it in a weird place. Unfortunately, you still need to play Persona 5 or Royal, to understand and appreciate the story and its characters. I say unfortunately but that isn't really a bad thing because you should 100% play the original games because they're amazing. \n\nNow onto Persona 5 Strikers story, you play as Joker again who returns for the summer vacation back to Shibuya. As he gets back together with the gang he again ends up in the prison where everything started in the original P5. He is warned that another calamity is about to happen just like before, even worse, and it's up to the Trickster to stop it again. \n\nThis time around you encounter Jails instead of Castles which are at their core the same but with a different skin/background. I won't spoil their nature but suffice to say they follow the same pattern, you roam around the maps which are more open now due to the nature of the gameplay, fight enemies, then the final boss, calling card all that, and repeat several times. Even the way the ending is presented is similar, you'll understand once you reach it. \n\nYou will meet new characters and some of them will even join your group to help you fight the upcoming calamity. As for the original cast, they're all back and they're all the same as you know and love them. Their presence is what makes the Persona 5 series great. Be warned though the game has a lot of dialogue in its full 45 hours and you'll be spending even an hour or more just listening and reading. \n\nStory rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs I've mentioned before P5S is a spin-off because this time around it's not a turn-based rpg anymore but an hack&slash with few rpg mechanics borrowed from the original game. \n\nThe core is there but simplified and turned into action. You roam around the maps, attack the enemies, and engage in combat but instead of turn-based, they now spread around the map and you basically Devil May Cry their ass using the Personas you gather or create which is the specific skill of the Trickster. The abilities and the Personas are the same but \"ported\" to live-action combat. What that means is besides slashing your way through huge waves of enemies, you can also use skills that you are familiar with in an aoe pattern. \n\nObviously, you will not be fighting alone and 3 of your preferred teammates will be there to assist you. They have their own AI and will use skills and attacks but you can switch to them and play as them if you want to which is highly encouraged especially on Hard. You cannot swap your teammates in combat, only outside, so make sure before a boss or tough sub-boss to be prepared who you have by your side. Their skills are also exactly the same as the original so you won't have to worry much about that if you played it. The spell combinations, technical damage, Persona, and enemy weakness are all back so really not much is changed at its core besides how combat is displayed. Boss fights are challenging on Hard but fair and they're really fantastic how they crafted and adapted the mechanics to the hack &slash style. \n\nAs P5S is no longer an rpg, all the bonds and talking and everything else you were used to in the original is gone or simplified. The bond system is a simple talent tree in which you spend points you gather progressively through the story and some side quests. Crafting Personas is also very simplified. If this were an actual rpg with mechanics improved from the original, it would've been an amazing experience but hey at least you can still cook stuff so that's a plus. \n\nGameplay rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nObviously, you can play the game with the English cast or the Japanese cast. I prefer Japanese games, set in Japan, to be played with their original voices, not dubs and I will always recommend it that way. Their voices fit well with their characters and if you played the original you'll feel right back at \"home\". The new cast also does a pretty great job at getting you emotionally invested. \n\nThe music is mostly from the original, which is of course, great, but there are some fantastic new tunes, especially the boss ones. As for the sound effects and everything else, all is good, no issues whatsoever. \n\nAudio rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nFor a console port, I can safely say it's a pretty good job. Not great, not perfect but still good considering this is the second Persona game on PC. It's still only locked to 60 FPS and there aren't that many graphical settings and as usual, the draw distances are weak but not much of an issue.  The game looks crisp in higher resolutions and details and combat effects and spells and whatnot are all nice to look at. \n\nThere are some crashes and it can be very annoying since there will be times where saving is very scarce and you just have to redo parts of the game or a long boss fight. Other than that, I have not encountered any other issues.\n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you haven't played Persona 5, then I don't think I can recommend Strikers but if you have there's absolutely no reason not to play it even if the gameplay is different. The characters you love are back and the story while similar in its beats, is still something nice to experience. \n\n[h1]Final score: 8/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Let me preface this review by saying that I do like Persona 5 Strikers. The tl;dr is that the gameplay is fun, there's a lot of content and there's a ton of depth in the game's fusion/Persona mechanics. But I can't recommend this game to newcomers and maybe even veterans for a simple issue; the game is horribly optimized. I'm running a 1650 and Ryzen 5 4600; not stellar components but respectable nonetheless. This game barely runs at 60 on mid/high settings at 900p. Its hilarrious just how poorly the game runs but even that isn't a dealbreaker. I wish the game ran better but I can handle a poorly optimized game as long as its stable but hoo boy is this game not stable. I'm around halfway through Strikers and I have had five separate crashes in my 20 hour playtime. Think about it, that's a crash every 4 hours. And the game doesn't have an autosave feature so you're bound to lose progress eventually. This is the ultimate reason why I cannot recommend P5S. If the game gets patches to solve the issues I've mentioned above, then yes, definitely buy this game. But for the time being, keep an eye out for a patch.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Gameplay is awesome, Story garbage, prone to crashing. SCORE: 7/10 Only recommend to fans, wait for Persona 5 for newbies.\n\nEvery review so far focuses on meme-like quotes or one thing that happens in the game. So, I'll tell you whats really in the game. The gameplay is more like Kingdom Hearts but with bigger mobs (not big mobs like Hyrule Warriors). It still retains Persona abilities and fusion but the fusion has been simplified from other entries. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and you have a fair bit of strategy to put into every fight especially the boss fights. The bosses alone will give you the sweatiest palms as they are harder than any of the Persona games by far. What I dislike about the game is its story. The Phantom Thieves are compelled to feel empathy for the antagonist of each city you go to. The writing feels very shallow even more so that in Persona 5. Also its been 20+ hrs for me and the game is still constantly holding my hand while traversing thru the maps. Like come on, don't insult my intelligence. And yes unfortunately the game is prone to crashing and it happens more often while transitioning to a new area. It becomes incredibly frustrating after you defeat an annoying boss and then the game crashes making you restart that fight. It's definitely worth $60 for returning Phantom Thieves but if this is your first Persona game I would wait until Atlus fixes the crashes and the game goes on sale for $40 or below. Also buy the Legacy BGM while you're at it, it makes the soundtrack much better!",

        "content": "It's important to note that this game has spoilers for the base Persona 5, but not for Persona 5 Royal.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a good addition to the story of Persona 5, a summer vacation turned into a Phantom Thieves work-based roadtrip across Japan. New additions to the cast, a wide variety of locations to explore, and 3D brawler style combat never before seen in a Shin Megami Tensei title keep things interesting.\n\nThough the gameplay is significantly different from other Persona titles, much has remained the same. That is to say, the things you loved about Persona 5, you'll love in Strikers; likewise, the thing you hated will still get on your last nerve.\n\nOne major pet peeve I've had with the game is the difficulty in avoiding combat. Persona 5's Palace navigation, specifically the cover system, made it very easy to pick and choose if and when you would like to engage in combat. In Strikers, cover is few and far between, and a lot of the locations you can dash to and hold position at will still leave you exposed to enemies.\n\nI've heard that a playthrough of this game averages at around 45 hours. This seems to line up for me; as of writing I am at 37 hours and about to enter the game's final story arc. Within this time frame, I have only crashed once, a pretty good feat considering Atlus has placed very few games on the PC.\n\nI wouldn't say that this game is a must-play, but if you enjoyed Persona 5 and want to see more of the Phantom Thieves' shenanigans, I'd definitely suggest picking Persona 5 Strikers up.",

There are some pro's and cons to this style of game though such as how tedious enemy's can be too annoying crashes in the game itself, overall it is worth playing with a wonderful story and okay after game content.

        "content": "A great addition to the persona franchise and gives you more of the P5 team that we all love.\nYes, it's not your typical persona game especially in the gameplay aspect but that is no reason why you can't enjoy it. It really fits the game and honestly, I enjoyed it more at times than the TBS variant, especially once you get into a flow with the mechanics. The other major thing that some will harp on is the lack of the \"social sim\" aspect, it's more as a group collective this time around instead of juggling your time between school, 1 on 1s and the metaverse, you tackle things as a team from start to finish. I don't believe that to be a drawback and fits in with the more fast paced nature of Strikers.\n\nThroughly fun game and would recommend to any Persona fan. Being a sequel to P5, the game will assume you know all prior events and the team members so if you never played P5 it is not \"friendly\" in that respect to totally new players. You can totally have fun with it but a lot will not make sense to you story or even character wise.",

The combat felt rewarding and wasn't just mindless button mashing, the music was top notch, and it was heartwarming to watch cast grow even more than how they did in vanilla P5. Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions and I really hope we get to see them again in the future assuming that this isn't the end. Now the story did feel rushed at times, but it was still a memorable experience overall that ended perfectly. I highly recommend this game to any Persona fan who's not yet ready to say goodbye to the Phantom Thieves just yet.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an enjoyable game, but doesn't quite stand up to the high bar set by P5 (and even higher bar set by P5R). The animations for All Out Attacks aren't quite as flashy, the game doesn't have as much meat to it, there are a lot of quality of life features missing, and much fewer voice clips for common actions like buying, selling, or aiming a gun (meaning that you're going to hear the exact same line spoken over and over and over again). However, saying that Strikers isn't as good as P5 or Royal is like saying an uncut diamond isn't as good as a 24-karat gold ring; in either case, what you have is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you've never played P5 before, don't be mistaken into thinking you can just leap into this game. It picks up after the events of the previous game and does very little to backtrack over who characters are or what events happened, which is great for returning fans since they can just right back into the action, but newcomers will be left totally lost. There is probably still an enjoyable story here for newbies, but he finer points will be lost--and considering just how important story is to the Persona series--it is a large thing to miss out on. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever return to this game now that I've beaten it. I honestly prefer the turn-based RPG battles of normal P5, and Royal is just filled with so much better content and quality-of-life features that I've grown so accustomed to that, should I ever feel the urge to jump back into Persona, I think I'll be popping in Royal long before Strikers. \n\nAll that said, however, this was still a damn fun game and I'm glad I played it. I feel like it's even worth full asking price if you're really a fan. If not, than there's no shame waiting for a sale, too. I think the enjoyment this game provides for Persona fans far surpasses any of it's minor gripes.",

        "content": "Awesome entry in the Persona series. As a side story it has a surprising amount of content. The gameplay is very simple to get into but also has enough depth to keep you entertained. My only negative points would be that it felt like it overstayed its welcome by about 10 hours. Also, the game has some unexpected difficulty spikes in weird places that require a fair bit of grinding. Any other negatives stem from the fact that its a musou/rpg hybrid and not a fully fleshed out rpg like the base game. Still there is plenty here to keep you playing. Its a great game in the Persona series and probably the best musou game I have ever played.",

        "content": "As someone with 400+ hours in the original Persona 5 game, I can say without a doubt that this is a worthy spin-off. The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it. I recommend this game especially if you loved P4G and P5/P5R. \n\nAnd of course, I, like everyone else, look forward to the inevitable Persona 3 and Persona 5 Royal PC port.",

It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.  I will say that if you have not played the previous Persona 5, then I do not recommend this to be your first game in the series.  The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!",

        "content": "I genuinely don't like the [b] original [/b] Persona 5. The characters and story all felt extremely bland to me, with its supposed themes being executed with the bare minimum of effort placed into it. Most characters were bland and some were even annoying. Including the wasted potential of the ideas the game presented, in the end it just left me unsatisfied. The only saving grace of the original game to me was the gameplay, the style, and a few tracks of the ost.\n\nThis game however [b] is not [/b] the original Persona 5 and it really shows, not just with its gameplay, but with its genuine thought and care placed into its characters and plot with only one minor hiccup being the obvious twist. Besides that this game blows the original P5 out of the park with everything it has to offer.\nThe game's new characters Zenkichi and Sophia are some of the best persona characters I've ever gotten to experience, Sophia specifically now being my all time favorite with her fun personality and amazing growth as a person, or in her case an AI. Learning about emotions as the story progresses and learning what it means to have a heart. Zenkichi isn't too far behind her though, being the first adult of the Phantom Thieves does bring in some fun banter between him and them all, usually with him being called \"Gramps\" and teased for being a bit of a dork. Him being part of the police as well adds some more chemistry with the Thieves bringing in a pretty fun dynamic between them reminding them they can't go and break the law for their shenanigans. Both of them make for amazing additions to an already set in stone team.\nThe themes presented with its villains really struck a cord with me this time around actually making me feel some emotion on my part. A majority of them even relate with some of the main characters own lives which makes for really interesting lines of dialogue where they reflect on it and how it must've affected the villains' thoughts.\nThe gameplay is absolutely outstanding with it's fast based combat, being similar to a warriors game of course it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really did enjoy it. Every characters moveset felt unique, fun, and extremely flashy. All of which just makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThere are negatives of course, this game may be close to a perfect 10 but there are a few glaring issues with the game.\nCrashes and soft locks aren't a common occurrence but they really shouldn't be happening in the first place considering how it never happens on consoles, I may have been able to get used to it but some people won't.\nThe way fusions work in this game feel incredibly tedious requiring incredibly low level personas to be at levels like 40 and 50 to create the fusion, which later on is a lot easier but in the beginning is absolutely annoying.\n\nBesides those issues however I really think this is the best Persona game in the series. Definitely not a jump on point for newcomers, but I really recommend it if you're already into persona and wanting a fun action game. It certainly made this P4 die hard quite happy.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

This game is a proper sequel to 5's story (not Royal's, sadly) and it feels a lot like the original without being too samey. The gameplay is very tight and fluid, and an excellent way of transitioning the turn-based RPG mechanics of the original to a real-time, action RPG styled game. \n\nThe story is excellent, especially if you already love the gang from 5, and the new character (not spoiler since you meet her about 10 minutes into the game) Sophia, is extremely lovable and adorable, and her reasons for being are very interesting. \n\nAll in all- I hard recommend this game for anyone who's a Persona 5 fan or a Musou game fan (but heavily recommend at least reading summaries of 5's story) I loved every bit of it, and big thanks to SEGA and ATLUS for bringing the game to PC.\n\n\n[spoiler] now, persona 5 strikers ROYAL when?

The wash of nostalgia and references to the previous game was a real roller coaster of emotions. They did it in such a way without spoiling too much for new players while also satisfying a veteran Persona 5 fan. The writing goes deeper to tackle more grey areas of everyday life with clashing philosophies and facts of life which tickle the brain to the open minded person. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself I was a little concerned that it was going to be a mindless hack and slasher without much depth. I've grown fond of the turn based strategy aspect of regular Persona games, but over time I found that the strategy was still there with faster paced decision making. I loved playing all the characters using familiar mechanics in a much more action packed battlefield. It felt really badass linking moves together with your team and landing those cinematic \"Showtime\" Finishers and All-Out Attacks. The music is a banger too. \n\nThe whole experience was wonderful. I can't wait to see what the Phantom Thieves do next !",

However, if you have not played Persona 5 beforehand, you'll feel a bit behind when the characters make references to things that haven't happened in this game before. If you want to know the full story but don't/can't play Persona 5, I would recommend watching Persona 5 The Animation as it will give you most of the character development needed to understand the relationship between our heroes. The only warning I should offer is that it does crash from time to time. I noticed it really only happened when I used a wireless controller, but once I switched to a wired connection I didn't notice any issues. Save frequently just in case that's not the reason. And although it is a jump from turn-based combat to an active combat system, the game is still extremely enjoyable.",

It is a true sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, basegame P5) as it keeps the superb character writing of the original while not falling to the general \"Persona spinoff character archetypes\".\nThe gameplay might be drastically different to the usual turn-based combat that the series is known for, but they've managed to make a great sequel that has such a different feeling.\nI will say though, the final few chapters of the story fall back on basically repeating story arcs from P5 but with minor twists. The game is aware of this somewhat, and it does come up as a joke that this is incredibly similar to what the thieves has already experienced.\n\nIf you like Persona 5 in any way, I would strongly recommend this game, just remember to save often as the game tends to crash on me randomly",

Without spoiling anything, the story seems to gloss over or ignore some previous pivotal moments from P5 Royal but still stays canon regardless. Absolute must-buy for anyone who played Persona 5!",

        "content": "With most of the negative reviews focusing entirely on the technical issues with the game, I figure I'll complain about the game itself just to shake things up a bit. There will be unmarked spoilers.\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Consider this more of a \"meh\" review. If you just wanna see the gang get back together for a demon-slaying road-trip, are willing to be even more fragile than the Demi-Fiend at the start of Nocturne, and don't mind bosses with insane HP values, it's stylish like Persona 5 always has been and may be worth picking up. YMMV with the story. Also, Futaba makes cute noises when you enter the system menu. This is very important.\n\n[b] Gameplay:[/b] Having tried Normal and Hard difficulty settings, it feels all over the place so far. Both incoming and outgoing damage fluctuates on a per-fight basis between being crushed by a black hole (dying/killing in 2-3 hits) or being slapped by a wet noodle, even when exploiting weaknesses. Taking advantage of persona resistances seems to work, but nothing will save your braindead AI companions from standing in pools of whatever element they're weak to and dying/wasting SP on healing. \n\nIt sucks because the most effective way to take down a boss, assuming you don't want to waste twenty minutes whittling it down while it endlessly spawns additional demons, is to stand still, open the command menu so time freezes, switch to a Persona that can exploit its weaknesses, and spam attacks, maybe switching to another character when you run out of SP. \n\nThis is almost necessary because bosses have an obscene amount of HP, and spamming attacks from the menu deals damage far faster than trying to use the free, reduced-strength spells from combos. It also has the side effect of practically guaranteeing you're not getting hit by anything while trying to pull off said combos, which feels really cheap.\n\n\n[b] Story: [/b] I haven't finished the game yet, but so far the stakes are at an all-time low for the Phantom Thieves. The first target was acceptable since she went out of her way to abuse some innocent people, but the second target in particular had me rolling my eyes; as far as I can tell, his only \"crime\" was not admitting that his novels were hot garbage that only sold well because his editors manipulated him and hyped up his status as the grandson of a famous writer. There was a claim about him plagiarizing, but he wouldn't be the first popular author to do just that and get away with it.\n\nForcing that kid to go on live television and \"confess\" to the heinous crime of being manipulated into writing bad novels had me in stitches. At best, it felt like petty revenge for something that happens all the time IRL in all kinds of media. At worst, it could have no lasting effect; realistically all the company would need to do is throw a few employees under the bus along with the kid in some kind of apology letter, wait a few months, and then the public would forget all about it.\n\nIn short, it's a far cry from changing the hearts of the people from Persona 5. Stopping a teacher from preying on students and driving them to suicide? I'm down, no question. \n\nStopping a famous idol from abusing the people around her? Sure, I guess. \n\nStopping a writer from writing bad novels?\n \n...\n\nWho gives a shit?",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.",

        "content": "Even though the game is only about 40 hours long It's a great game and a sequel to Persona 5, The cutscenes are amazing and voice acting and lines are better than the original game in my opinion, The new characters are fun to play with and also have great voice acting. The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series",

        "content": "I was positively surprised with the complexity of combat system - every mechanic present in Persona 5 is here, from All-out-Attacks, Baton Passes to Showtime Attacks, with some new additions. Seriously, combat is *really* good. Personas fusions and customizations are also very good, even if there are fewer Personas than in the mainline games.\n\nUnfortunately, the other main part of Persona gameplay loop, the time management, is non-existent here. While a shame, it's understandable based on the premise of the game; P5S shows a much more compact story than mainline Persona games, and there's little place for in-depth systems from the original, such as Confidants and such.\n\nAs for the quality of the PC port... crashes and weird antialiasing aside, trying to set up a working keyboard and mouse controls almost gave me an aneurysm. KB+M default controls seem to be made by a person who never touched a PC. All in all, it didn't diminish my experience by much, just made the first two hours of so more frustrating then they need to be.\n\nAll in all, I was afraid this game would be a cheap cashgrab, feeding on the love people have for Persona 5. But it's not, there's a lot of actual quality here; you just need to remember it's a action spin-off, not full Persona experience.",

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers. Look foreword to it.\n\nI was glad to hang out with these weird kids in japan again, and I was not disappointed.",

It reflects off of Persona 5 and they still keep the Persona 3 vibe, style, and music like its other games. \n\nIf you are a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei, and the older Persona series, you will like this.\n\nAlthough the game's style is much different, and inspired by the types of fighting style games like\nHyrule Warriors Age of Calamity, and Dynasty Warriors.\n\nIts a mobby hack and slash game, so if you want a ton of action this is a much get. Its not a turn based\nRPG like the other titles but you still kick some ass.\n\nWhats great is that instead of just trying to remember a ton of moves, they have them shown\ndown at the bottom of the window of your game to show you what to press if you dont remember how to do\nsome moves. You can also look at the tutorials again in the Options Menu in case you missed something.\nInstead of mashing at the keys, its good to get to know your moves. If you dont you may lose much faster especially\nif you run into a mid boss or something nasty.\n\nIts got a ton of Story, good Music, it has its suspense moments, and comedy too. It has that Anime/Manga feel of it as well.\n\nIm not a reviewer snob (like yelpers) but just leaving an honest review, and its gameplay.\n\nI think the only thing i would complain about is that they dont leave an option to watch the cutscenes\nyou just completed. So if you want to see them again, you dont get to.\n\nI have the bonus content they dont provide any of the animations, only the behind the scenes of the production.\n\nOther than that its still a solid, and clean game. I havent ran into any bugs yet. \n\nThe game is flashy, its colorful, its not plain, and the Ui looks pretty good.\n\nWorth every penny. Buy it!! BUY IT NOW!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL HERE OwO!\n",

        "content": "I definitely enjoyed this game, but I do have a few bones to pick. Overall? I love it, and definitely recommend it. But I also can't imagine enjoying it anywhere near as much if I hadn't played the prequel.\n\nLoved:\n\n- The travelling by camper van premise. And you can still decorate inside - Nice touch.\n\n- Yusuke. No lie, he's my favourite character. So weird, and usually the one to make me crack a smile or laugh.\n\n- Graphic style. Easy on the eyes!\n\n- Characters, in general. You definitely get a good dose of each of their personalities in the game, which is great.\n\n- Game mechanics. I'm fine with turn-based games, as Persona has been until now, but real time is definitely so much more fun. You can use also use objects in the environment to pull off different moves. Not novel or anything, but definitely makes the battles more dynamic. \n\n- The voice acting. I usually listen to the original voices over the English voices because the latter often bothers me. But here? The voice actors nailed it. Lots of emotion, tone, and personality. That said, I suggest changing the audio configuration ASAP in game, as I find of the base levels of background volume to voice volume to be imbalanced, and sometimes I could not hear the voices over the background music.\n\n- Music was great, as always (okinawa jail bgm is one of my favourites in the game). The upbeat and catchy songs were also very fitting. Having some of the music and songs from P5 was a nice touch/connection, as well.\n\nBones to pick:\n\n- Game length. I did everything possible in about 43 hours in my first run, and I took my time. It's action and content packed with not too many extras, but I had expected there to be a good 20 more hours (including extras) considering its predecessors. I ended up cursing the whole \"only 1 month of summer vacation\" standard of Japan as the reason why the game had to be \"short\".\n\n- Linear/simple story. Doesn't usually bother me, but having played other persona games, it's simple by comparison.\n\n- Personas. So many were cut out in this game - and Persona 5 already had a bunch cut from Persona 4...I had been looking forward to discovering them, seeing how they'd be animated and going to town with them, but there are definitely far fewer.\n\n- Less sneaking around. Ambushing enemies from behind sofas, tables, corners etc in P5 had been fun. In this game it's mostly ambushing from above in some form - nice add-on, but I don't think it should have replaced the other ambush methods. I had also anticipated ambushing from actual shadows/blind spots, which happens in P5, but there wasn't really any of that in this game. It also bothered me that you could perch on some things but not others - e.g. traffic poles (Shibuya arc), but not the concrete lanterns/posts, or even low rooftops (Kyoto arc)? Couldn't see the logic behind that. Also a little disappointed that you couldn't ambush from trees. I guess because of the \"phantom dash\" distance you could leap to various perches, it seems the potential for the context was too limiting.\n\n- I do miss the one on one, sometimes one on two, bonding scenarios from P5. You get a handful of bonding chances in Strikers, but not many. Instead it focuses on group bonding, which shows how tight the Phantom Thieves group is. \n\nPetty disappointments:\n\n- Protagonist has virtually no role this game. Kinda just there to watch his friends be the ones to help/inspire others this time. Would have been nice if each character had their own arc, in addition to the group dynamic, like P5 did.\n\n- Protagonist wears his glasses all game. I was hoping I could take them off...As far as what's been suggested he doesn't even need them, anyway!",

That and the crashing problem but hopefully they can update it and fix that.  The game crashed for me about 10 times but luckily I didn't lose too much data.  Other than these two things, I really love this game!!  It is so much fun to play.  Just walking around and enjoying the scenery and the music is fun.  The fighting is also fun.  I'm still working on doing the extra stuff so I'm not completely finished yet but I have to say that I think this game is so awesome.  I was looking forward to playing it for the past couple of months and it did not disappoint in the least.  I did play Persona 5 a while ago so I know everyone well and it's really cool that they made this so that we can see them again.  Everyone is just as cool as they were before and there are a couple new characters who are also very cool.  The voice actors are all very good (I use the Japanese).  The graphics are also very good.  It's very shiny and bright.  Overall, I will give this game an A+++++.  I will keep at it until I get everything and then I'll probably start over.  I think it's nice that they give you the option to select your difficulty level.  Next time I play, I will try hard mode.  I don't suppose there is any chance of them making another sequel but I can dream.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Persona games.

        "content": "Alright, so you can enter into this game with no knowledge of the P5(royal not needed) and be fine, you can understand and like this story, it just improves it if you do know.\n\nGame play, first ever muso(idk the spelling of the game) I've played that I feel challenged in from something other than more hp. You actually have to use your brain while playing. Also although not a turnbased game like mainline persona games, it translates the persona turn based elements very well in gun and skills.\n\nStory, so far characters have been great, entire cast is back, with 2 new main characters who are both interesting. Charters feel exactly as they should be and story is intriguing, and it's neat how with the jails it seems each jail owner didn't make it through desire, but trauma, so it makes the villans more interesting.\n\nAlso it's basically P52, which is funny because in one of the trailers a 2 almost appeared after the \"5\" and then \"S\" butted it out. It is a sequel.\n\nVisuals, Looks like a persona 5 game, but not only that the jail aspects are really polished, not only does each jail seem unique, the quality of the details is amazing. Other muso games seem to not care all that much, but this one just random buildings may have defined shops and markets or be their own specific thing. It's not just slightly different colors. Nor is it copy and paste. Though this does come at a cost. It's not one big map but many decent size areas per jail with load times. I'm on a gaming laptop and can run it at around 1.5 resolution, max graphical settings, 60 frames non combat(btw max cap is 60, so wait till someone mods it for that to change) which lowers to 40 in hectic combat(which I never actually notice, unless i'm looking at my fps number). I say all this is because between each area it's about 10-20 seconds. Which isn't short enough to ignore nor long enough to alt tab. This is my biggest complaint with the game and that's saying a lot. \n\nAll i can say is compared to muso games this is probably the best(although i've heard hyrule warriors was made by the same studio so maybe that's just as good) in every department.\n\nI would recommend buying this game at full price even if not a persona fan. \n\nNot a giant downside to me but the social life aspect is toned down a lot. P5R was I'd say 25 percent social life, 60 percent game, and 15 percent cutscene, this is 65 percent game, 25 percent cutscene, and 10 percent social life",

The new battle system was addicting and it worked very well and I loved having the whole Persona 5 cast from the start. The concept of taking a road trip across Japan in classy 50's Style RV was just Icing on the Cake! Overall I enjoyed the game I just wish there were social links and the areas you Visited were bigger and you could go inside buildings and explore, which I hope they do for Persona 6. Well Done Atlus please bring Persona 3 FES to steam too and give it the same treatment as P4 Golden. And make sure we can control are party members!",

        "content": "In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games, Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That\u2019s a bold move, and it\u2019s emblematic of the entire experience. As we\u2019re introduced to the complex yet approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven\u2019t been in a Persona game in over a decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series has been building to, with familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix.\nIn what\u2019s by far the series\u2019 strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you\u2019ll attend class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts.\nShare.\n\nThese stand-out dungeons take place in \u201cpalaces\u201d created within the mind of each target, and Atlus takes advantage of this to set them in diverse and outlandish places. Unlike the procedurally generated halls of Persona 3\u2019s Tartarus or Persona 4\u2019s Midnight Channel, Persona 5\u2019s labyrinths are fully hand-built and feature unique puzzles and mechanics that vary with the theme of each dungeon and never repeat. A museum, for example, has very different security measures than a Medieval castle, and you\u2019ll find very different enemies in a pyramid than you might in a spaceship. Assembling pieces of secret codes to solve a bank vault\u2019s cryptogram or positioning tiles to interpret hieroglyphics feel almost like entirely different games. This gives each palace a sense of identity tied to the target and provides some smart, unpredictable story moments and challenges.\nPersona 5\u2019s sense of scope is staggering compared to Persona 3 or 4.\n This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.",

It definitely ties more into Persona than the Muso genre as a whole and I was hooked after the first few hours. The new characters are great additions, so much so, I am kind of upset they weren't in the original game to begin with. If you were on the fence, thinking this was going to be a typical button smasher, you're in luck because it's far from that, as it mixes in a lot of Persona elements from it's turn based style of game. It might not be for everyone, but for anyone just looking for another fun adventure with the Phantom Thieves, P5S will not disapoint.",

You also start combat like in Persona 5 rather than have all enemies on the map at all times, so neither battles nor zones are as big or open as warriors titles usually are. If that sounds good then go for it since this is probably one of Koei's best games, but if you were expecting a traditional warriors game you might be disappointed.",

A little light on the story as far as Atlus games go but still very long cutscenes and such, just more focused on action now which is fine because it works well! I just beat it and it's one of my favourites game of all time, my god I love Atlus games they just work so well and I got over 50 hours and still going for post game stuff!",

        "content": "Pretty fun hack-and-slash experience that still makes you stay on your toes via the Weakness and Strength etc. system. The story was pretty good but felt a bit restrictive with what the player can do on their daily life, something older fans may dislike but isn't that big of an issue. \n\nGraphics are alright although it did have some optimal issues (game crashing whenever leaving the Metaverse or frames dropping drastically out of nowhere).\n\nCharacters are solid still including the newer ones that were introduced for this game. Their backstory really show how and why they ended up like how they were in the game and it really showed how much resolution they have achieved by the end. \n\nControls on the other hand were very complicated in my opinion (on keyboard) so a controller is highly recommended as it makes the game way easier (and it solves the massive frame drop issue if you disconnect it and reconnect it).\n\nStory was alright, the way it introduced the villain's backstories really makes you feel for them and want them to change for the better. The story could be better in my opinion but given the circumstances (in game time restrictions) \n\noverall, again, a nice hack and slash anyone can play. Although I believe that the experience is way better when you have played Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. Still a game anyone can pick up and give a try and be welcomed to the series",

Story is good, though a good part will be lost if you haven't played Persona 5, which you should anyway (if you don't own a PS3 or PS4, it works flawlessly on RPCS3 (PS3 emulator) as long as you have a good CPU). The only bad thing about it is there isn't more of it (it's still 40-60 hours, and it's all great). There's also no New Game+, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's patched in later as you can save your clear data.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best new games I've played in the last 5 years if not longer. If you've played Persona 5, you'll probably love it, and if you haven't, then what the hell are you waiting for?",

With a few exceptions, the entire game feels exactly like the first game did; menus, dungeons, boss designs...  It's incredible.  I was expecting a musou game more in-line with the others I've played; Hyrule and Fire Emblem Warriors.  Gone are the big battlefields of those games, replaced with small, tighter skirmishes that fit this sort of game better.\n\nThis game would be nearly perfect in my eyes, except for one thing: Denuvo.  Denuvo made my game crash more than a handful of times.  It was a serious drag each time I had to reload and go back sometimes to upwards of an hour.  Sega needs to remove it from the Steam version ASAP.  I had a friend who gave me a launcher without Denuvo, and in those last few hours of gameplay, not only did the game run better and load faster, but it didn't crash once.  \n\nThat aside, if you liked Persona 5, absolutely give this game a shot.  It was the sequel I didn't know I could have.",

Combat is enjoyable and the way combos expand the more you play as each character is a good way to get you playing everyone and seeing each thief's arsenal while in combat. I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less. It is not a great port over onto PC and with these issues being so irregular, be prepared to what you could end up dealing with.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an amazing game. \n\nActing as a sequel to, and taking place during the summer after the events of Persona 5, you get to reunite with the members of the Phantom Thieves to travel across Japan, traversing \"Jails\" in order to save humanity. Unlike the turn-based combat style of the original Persona 5, Strikers has combat similar to the 1 vs many style of the Dynasty Warriors games, with fluid transitions between combat and traversing the Jails.\nThe game has a great story that builds upon the world of the original game, and I definitely welcomed new characters like Zenkichi and Sofia, but I would suggest not playing this game until you play Persona 5 first, because this game is a sequel and spends no time introducing people. \n\nLike other Persona games, the soundtrack is phenomenal and a joy to listen to. \n\nHowever, in regards to the PC version, I have had issues with the game crashing several times (only during loading screens), so remember to save often.\n\n*Note: I would not advise completing all achievements for this game, mainly because you will need to max out all BOND Skills, which took me over 10 hours exclusively grinding one boss over and over again just to get enough EXP to complete the achievement.",

Definitely think this was developed to be as friendly to newcomers as possible. \n\nStill a good game though, 7.5/10...........Now bring the proper Persona 5 to PC Atlus!",

I am fans of dynasty warrior game since on playstation 2, and this battle system with my favorite persona character is really awesome. especially every persona move has different specials! I play on easy mode since I am casual pleb and no time to grind exp/item, tried normal mode at early stage and I keep dying from the 1st boss til I find out I have to grind exp to create persona that allow me to deal weakness on the boss and it's all become so easy and just reading the boss move pattern. for now I am just focusing on completing the game, might be continue on normal mode after I finished. Normal mode does give you those code vein boss vibes since you have to be careful on the attack, but here the boss have really high HP so all you need is timing and reading move pattern. \n\nHope this kind of combat will continue to Persona 6.\n\nTLDR : 10/10 will recommend to everyone who likes musou game. and a must have for persona lover.",

        "content": "(Written at Ver. 1.0.0, please verify accuracy on future versions.)\nTO SUMMARIZE:\nI really like this game as a sequel to Persona 5. Standalone, the most glaring thing is you're dropped straight in assuming you already understand Persona 5's plot. While I feel like you would enjoy the game regardless, I highly recommend visiting the first Persona 5 game. If you're in a pinch, watch a playthough or in the worst case scenario the anime (though not very well received.)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI have had numerous crashes since the early release day and to my knowledge there is no fix yet, which is a little off-putting. If you do decide to get this game for PC, please practice good saving habits if only for this reason. Save as often as possible, as this game does *not* autosave. While I still enjoyed the experience overall, the crash issue made me wish I got it for console instead. There are also a few game-breaking bugs which you will have to avoid. For example, you cannot play in fullscreen or borderless windowed modes or the game will go into a black screen if you trigger a cutscene. You must play in windowed mode as far as  my experience has shown me.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay combines aspects of Persona 5's JRPG elements and combat, with musou mechanics you're probably familiar with most \"Warriors\" games. While it has its flaws, I never found myself bored. Fights felt interesting, though sometimes downright easy playing on \"Normal.\"\n\nAs a note to Atlus, you've got to be more timely with bug-fixes and more courteous to your PC audience if you want to keep going with this PC release approach. At the very least keep some sort of communication with the player base acknowledging the issues.\n\nSTORY:\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of the original Persona 5. It does not take into consideration your past romance(s?) or confidants, nor can I say it makes any clear reference to the events of Persona 5 Royal. You may notice some themes being reused in the first few levels of the game that are similar to Persona 5's palace themes. I will say, however, that they are distinct enough to not feel like a rehash. The antagonists feel unique, and contrast heavily from the precursor of this game. \n\nOverall, without giving anything away, while the writing is definitely not as good as before it's pleasant for those already familiar with the first game, showing strong character growth in contrast and an interesting new evil to take on. I personally believe this is a worthy sequel story-wise.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI'm hoping the glitches are resolved for the PC release at some point. That said, I can comfortably recommend this game to people who are itching for more of the Phantom Thieves adventures, those looking to beat up massive hordes of shadows, or even if you're really weird and want to get introduced to Persona 5 with this game! I'm giving the game a thumbs up, but begrudgingly so in light of the current state of the PC release. But for my purposes, this game was worth the occasional crash and being forced to play in Windowed mode.",

I haven't had a crash since day 1; on Day 1, I had three crashes. I found the suggestion from a user who had tried making sure the game ran in Administrator and it fixed all of their issues.\n\nI have friends suggesting that the Kyoto boss area is basically unwinnable right now, and it has a crash right after that you can't get past. I'm looking to try and see if that happens to me, as I'm a few in-game days away from that particular date.\n\nThis game is great, the port itself needs some tweaks, but apparently Atlus nor Koei Tecmo plan to do shit about it.\n\nI've lost a lot of respect for Atlus, and now I'm not sure if they deserve any more of my money past this point; Persona 4 Golden was a beautiful port, and it was patched with the majority of its issues solved within days.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks from this game's release and not a fucking word of anything getting changed or improving.

        "content": "So, how do I start with this review?\nHalf an hour ago, after 60 hours of playing I finally finished P5Strikers and I am blown away. I LOVED P5 on the PlayStation 4 (didn't play P5R yet, ATLUS, PLS BRING IT ON PC, I BEG YOU) and I do love P5Strikers even more, kinda. Although I couldn't build my romance-ship with Futaba, like in P5...\n\nThe gameplay is in my opinion not just like a normal ''Warriors''-Hack and Slash-kinda gameplay, it is basically a combination of using your Persona-Skills correctly or in the right situation and more or less just smashing your 2 attack-buttons. For those, who like the ''Warriors''-games, you will DEFINITELY love this piece of indescribable and beautiful art. The ''Hack and Slash''-Combat doesn't feel boring nor repetitive, like in the original ''Warriors''-series, which is because of the HUGE variety of Personas you can have (just like in the original P5) and how ATLUS/Koei Tecmo/Omega-Force integrated the usage of the Personas, is just awesome.\n\nThe story is just awesome. No worries, I won't say ANYTHING about the story. It plays half a year after the story of P5 and  has a lot of moments, where it brings you to almost crying, but it can INSTANTLY change your sad mood into a very happy mood, because of a sudden joke or such little things, which make the story, the characters and their bond just absolutely amazing and wonderful. Speaking of the characters, each of the already known Phantom Thieves and all of the new characters newly introduced to this story are completely well written, each has their own little ''story'' and ''highlight'' in this game - Atlus, you are just amazing in writing characters and stories for your games.\n\nWhat else can I say? I am again cmpletely amazed because of an Atlus-game, which isn't anything special, because, as I've said, Atlus is absolutely A M A Z I N G in writing stories + characters.\n\nEvery city, that you will see is individually designed, nothing looks like the other, the Meta-Verse is truly amazing designed, the bosses all have great designs and I can not stop simping about this game (or Futaba, heh).\n\nI hope for everyone, who will read this, that I could help you a little bit, if you have troubles, buying this game, because you needed a second opinion. <3\n\nOh, two things left....\n1. FUTABA IS WAIFU, FUTABA FOR LAIFU <3\n\n2. ATLUS - PLEASE - PERSONA 5 ROYAL FOR PC AND MAKE AGAIN A SEQUEL FOR THE BEST PHANTOM THIEVES ON THE EARTH!!!!!\n\nP.S.: Sorry for my bad english, couldn't decide, if I should write this review on English or German, so yeah xD",

I bought this game expecting the game to be like all the muosu games where there is a big roster and map and you just beat the crap out of everyone\n\nfirst hour into the game I found it is completely different. The combat mechanics is the same but this is still a persona game with almost all the elements from the previous persona 5 game. there are still lovely conversations between the thieves and the side stories like dining out or going on a stroll . \n\nIn the battles you can use the normal combat system from muosu games but also the persona skills. When in combat if you are any of the thieves you can use their personas skills to deal elemental or physical damage and if you are playing as the Joker, you can pick any persona you have and use their skills. You can obtain personas by chance if they drop a mask if you defeat them. You can also create personas by fusing other personas. \n\nPersona 5 had confidants level where you can increase their level by interacting with each person but in this game, they introduced bond level instead. Any interaction with the phantom thieves increases the bond bar. with every level you get 3 bond points that you can spend on any skill you would like. There are many skills t obtain and the skills itself can be leveled up so thats a great way if you want to focus on magic boosts or like healing bonuses and any different build you think of . \n\nif you enjoyed persona 5, you will enjoy this 100% . don't take this game as cheap muosu game, its another persona 5 game but with real time combat instead of turn base. I am currently 13 hours in the game and just finished the first chapter of the game and starting the second one. 50$ for this game is great price for what the game has to offer. \n\n100% recommend this game",

For those wondering this game has a lot of dialogue so far, my first 2.5 hours were spent in dialogue, the rest in running around and fighting. \n\nThe soundtrack is essentially the same, if not slightly tweaked and revamped from P5 which already had a kick-ass soundtrack. Controls are easy to get accustomed to (on an actual controller and not my KBM). \n\nDo be warned, from what I read before I purchased this game the default, out of the box AA sucks and it's best to use your GPU's settings to force a better AA. Also for those that have anything north of a 60hz monitor it won't do you any good, this game is capped at 60 FPS, but I don't think this game is too terribly difficult to run. My 5700XT/3600x with everything maxed out in-game, and in the GPU control panel I'm easily getting a constant 60 FPS. \n\nThe combat is fluid, no hiccups, stutters, nada just hack away and have fun.",

The idea to just fully remove the big mass combat maps sounds crazy and like it would completely break such a game, but it turns out it does just the opposite, it makes the combat able to use far more abilities and intricacies because there's only 20-30 enemies now, not 400-1000.\n[*]Persona 5 oozed style at every corner, and this carries the torch perfectly. Even the menus are - once again - overstylized to hell and back, the game is full of fancy animations, all fitting the theme.\n[*]Speaking of theme, wow the audio is even better than P5 or P5R. It really raises the bar for such games.\n[*]Combat is surprisingly challenging depending on difficulty chosen, because counters, interactions and avoidance have a lot of meaning and you can die in 2-3 hits if you use the wrong character at the wrong moment.\n[*]The story - as far as I can tell yet - is quite good, and easily blows anything any Warriors game has done before out of the water.\n[/list]\n\nSo, why no recommendation? Well, there's the problem that a significant amount of people experience quite frequent crashes to desktop. Sure, most games exhibit these for some hardware configurations but here it seems more that a majority see them, most people just rather rarely. And some people see them a lot. Also from reports around the web it seems those who have the accidentally released denuvoless version installed do [b]not[/b] suffer from these crashes. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is: You may want to hold off until they patch out Denuvo.",

Story wise, it's a great continuation of the main P5 game, but it \nlacks the social links (which i often found too time consuming in P5). The combat \nsystem is super easy to learn, but tends to become a litlle button mashy at times. \nYou can leave and enter dungeons multiple times a day without the time progression \npenalty of the original, so the pressure of not having enough time is gone for good.\nAlso, it will help a lot if you played P5 on Playstation, as the story is hard to under-\nstand if you don't know what happened before the events of P5S.\n\nIt will run fine on any middle class gaming PC from 3 years ago, which is a big plus.\nMy game crashed two times (in a dialogue scene in Sapporo) so be sure to save\nwhenever you can so you won't loose progress, as this game doesn't have autosave.\n\nI hope it sells well on Steam so we can see more Persona on the PC after P4G and P5S!",

        "content": "TLDR: Finished Persona 5?  Get this.  Never played Persona 5?  Probably not for you.\n\nIf you've played Persona 5 and are on the fence about this because of it being Dynasty Warriors combat, take the plunge.\n\nThe combat is actually way more Persona than I expected.  In fact, for difficult fights I spent way more time hitting the Persona button, exploiting weaknesses, switching characters to heal/buff, etc.  In any event, as someone who usually really doesn't care for DW, I found the combat in the game pretty enjoyable.  The dungeons were at least as interesting as anything P5 was doing, too.\n\nUnlike typical DW games, the draw here is the story.  This one is a direct story sequel to the Persona 5.  If you liked that story and want to just hang out with the dudes again on a road trip around Japan doing Phantom Thieves stuff, then play this game.  You don't get the time management social game from the mainline Persona games, but you get a full-fledged, consistent with Persona 5, sort of on-rails story.  It's really solid.\n\nOne other thing that I didn't really expect, the general presentation of the game is also pretty consistent with the quality of Persona 5.  The wild animations, menus, punk rock aesthetic, the music, voice acting... it's all here and it's very much a continuation of what P5 had going on.\n\nAll that said, with how much time and energy is spent on a story that assumes you played Persona 5, even if you really dig the combat for it's own sake, this is only really for people who have played and finished P5.  The story here is good, but it does not at all stand on its own 2 feet.  Tons of references to the events of P5 and definitely an assumption that you're already familiar with the cast.",

It takes a minute and a half to actually get ingame, and pretty much every scene transition takes about ten seconds. I am playing this game on an RTX 3080 with an i9 10900k on an SSD, it's absolutely ridiculous that this doesn't load pretty much instantly.\n-I've had the game crash to desktop with no error code/warning three times. First was at the very beginning of the game, but the other two crashes were after I had made significant progress in a Jail.\n-Anti-Aliasing is of poor quality and causes the text to become blurry.\n-Framerate is stuck at 60. Not sure if they tied game logic to framerate, but if it's possible to update it that'd be cool.\n\nI'm really hoping that somebody at Atlus takes the time to fix these issues and this isn't a traditional quick PC port where they dump it on Steam and forget about it, because the game itself is great. And even if it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, I'll definitely update the game to recommend it if they at least fix the loading/crashing issues.",

        "content": "So right off the bat the game is great, solid 8 or 9 out of 10, and if you think you'll like it, or even if you're on the fence, I'd recommend picking it up at some point. \nIt is quite rare for me to purchase a game at full price after a release, but I want this release to do incredibly well so that atlus, and by extension sony, will see the profit and bring games like persona 5 royal(please), God of War, Bloodborne, etc more quickly to pc. This being said I won't be softening any criticisms below whats here is a genuine face value of the game.\n\nAnimation, story, and interaction\n-This game is purely more persona 5 with it's character interactions. Given there is no confidant system or romance options, so waifu wars don't work here, but if you enjoyed the casual phantom thief bits from persona 5 this is a treat.\n-The music is purely high quality stuff, mostly all of the new tracks written for this game sound great. From the first prison's music to the final bosses it's all persona standards, and even if you aren't a fan of it, the game allows any persona music to be the main soundtrack.\n-Most of the animations are pretty well done, primarily the new showtime special attacks are beautifully done, each character has their own unique animation matching their personality. Honestly Joker has the most basic sadly because of his many persona options.\n\nThe Gameplay    \n Perspective of a playthrough on hard first time using a ps4 controller via an xbox controller layout\n\nFrankly I love the combat style of this game, it advertises itself as being a hack in slash, which by technicality is true. Coming from a hard difficulty perspective, I entirely believe that hard is the best way for this game to be experienced. \nBasic attacks and combos --- Basic attacking is unique to each character however they all share similarities. Combos are all simple at face value being either   X-Y    X-X-Y     or   X-X-X-Y                 but they can get depth from stringing them together, but what makes the combo system unique is how each of those inputs will cast a persona skill, whether it be a buff, debuff, or skill. These combos likewise use no precious sp, so in longer fights they are instrumental so that joker doesn't develop magic dysfunction as the boss pulls out a second health bar. \n\nMore advanced unique movesets ---  each character has specially made attack animations and mechanics and I will attempt to list them here without any spoilers. Some overlap but that's to be expected\nJoker- has a basic dagger gun moveset based around getting quick persona combos\nRyuji- focuses on charged hits that deal incredible damage, and can prevent staggering with a self buff\nAnn- Can imbue her whip with fire that allows her to deal with an enemies weakness from basic attacks\nMorgana- simple normal moveset, becomes car for special moveset. nuff said\nYusuke- Is based around unique combo counts, where Y activates a parry frame, and if successful he can add more hits to a combo counter\nHaru- Purely aoe strength, her persona combo strikes are large and lingering and all of her hits are powerful\nMakota-buffs her large combo attacks with nuclear, uses johana to ride down enemies with X-X-X-Y\nFutaba has the same role to the point of redundancy. The largest change is the added support where she increases showtime gauges\n\nCounterstrikes\nNot only is this my favorite track in the game against japanese ironman lol, but it is a skill in the new bond system that I quite like. This skill means any last minute dodges allow the character to immediately retaliate with a persona attack. Get this skill immediately it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThief dash aka area hopscotch \n-dash to a piece of scenery and interact with it dealing damage of a certain type. Honestly I really like this system, I like the little differences in character the interactions show, and it gives the player more control over the terrain. All bosses use the interaction really neatly as well with the least creative being the final boss who I won't spoil\n\nOkay now time for the nitpicks\nThe slightly bad \n\nSpammed with tutorials at the beginning - LIKE DEAR GOD the first few hours of the game you won't escape these things. It's like they were stalking me waiting to pop out from a corner EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT BURN. Like they serve a purpose but if you already know how the status works from persona 5 you will get annoyed fast. Doesn't help that they give you messages about EVERY character when you switch to them, which playing all of them from the beginning, it gets irritating fast.\n\nThe game always has you fighting with 3 other ai controlled phantom thieves unless you take them off of your party, and I would discourage doing this. Usually the ai are protected from their own stupidity by generous I frames and resistance to attacks, and they seem to avoid using sp..........Unless they are healing\n               \nHOWEVER, some times the ai just get in your way, they will die like idiots and leave you fighting alone, just because the game didn't save them. Like for instance, and I'll avoid spoilers, but one boss creates stupid walls of lasers to hit you, and these things move incredibly slowly. I'd have to drop my controller on the floor to get hit by these things, but the ai will not avoid them. They don't understand that the back of the platform is the only safe spot so they stand there and get whacked. It's honestly infuriating.\n\n-So this is a genuine problem but a strange one. So this game lacks all interaction with side characters who weren't phantom thieves, so there is no takemi or iwai in this game which is already pretty sad. Instead their shops are combined into a shop Sophie runs from wherever the thieves are at that moment. Now breaking the disbelief that sitting in the middle of an island a delivery could get there in a matter of moments, this shop seems like a good way to get the thieves items from anywhere. The problem lies in the amount you can buy, as the amount is always from 1-4 of an item, including healing(I think the most is a 120 heal later in the game which you can get 4 of at a time). Throughout the game this isn't an issue, it works well in fact to stop you from skyrim healing through every fight, BUT AT THE END, there is a gauntlet of tough refights with bosses as well as dangerous shadows for the postgame content. This practically requires decent health resources as well as sp items, but the only way to restock this dumb shop is by spending time in the metaverse, but not just that winning fights. That means you have to run through an area killing everything several times over to get the heath resources needed to beat some of this tough fights. The shop also contains incredibly rare cooking items, specifically that POS coffee bean that is never there but is needed for 2 post game special recipes, so get to grinding that last area. I swear if the enemies in that last area weren't pushovers to a grenade launcher I would have lost my sanity\n\n-This game has no Satanael. None of the awakened personas from persona 5 are here, every single member of the main cast has their originals, Morgana still has gorro, Ryuji still has captain kid, Ann has Carmen, Haru, has M'lady etc. It's pretty mentally annoying especially since Morgana HAD to become max rank as a confidant, and thus had to have an evolved persona.\n\nOkay THE REALLY BAD\n-The game has a bug where it softlocks after a particular boss...... This did not affect me but it is worth noting\n-There can be infinite loading screens........This did not affect me\n-The game doesn't start for some people\n- And finally the most annoying one, this thing crashes randomly in loading screens, and it's painful and this one did affect me. I had to live in fear half the time because I had made significant progress, and a visit to Lavenzia could outright delete that time spent. It was frankly awful and has not been patched as of this review.",

        "content": "Great music as always, with remixes and new tracks. Story is a little better than expected out of a spinoff game, though no mentions of Royal content whatsoever is disappointing. The core gameplay is actually really fun and not as much of a deviation from traditional combat as you'd think, and it really allows for showing how cool the Phantom Thieves are meant to look. The Personas available feel very limiting (especially the late game ones) but fusion is relatively in depth and fun to play with. The real life exploration is also constricted but the different settings are charming and it's nice to have.\n\nMy only major complaint is the crashing, which is a complete pain in the ass in a game without autosave. Other than that, there are only a few small annoying issues, such as shop items having incredibly low stock, money being a major bottleneck even after 80 hours + full completion, way to many BOND skills, and Persona stat changes feeling useless.\nOverall, P5S is a fun game that Persona 5 fans will almost certainly have fun with.",

        "content": "An amazing game through and through. I loved the story, the characters old and new, the English voice acting which I am so glad Atlus waited until the English cast finished their recording despite the pandemic (Taylor Harvey playing persona 5 strikers\u2019s Sophie is such a great fit).  Finally the message Persona 5 strikers delivers. From the start I had worries of it being very slow pace due to how it set up. But once it kicks in. Oh it kicks in all right.  \n\nAs for the gameplay. For me personally the warriors style game play does get a bit repetitive during the ending just spamming magic and just using sp items to do more magic rinse and repeat but as a Dynasty Warriors fan. It\u2019s just so much fun. I really enjoyed it and would recommend those who are fans of persona to try it out or those who are interested in the warriors famoula (just a warning might want to start on hard since normal feels far too easy). Sure it\u2019s not your jrpg but for the plot and message it brings. Persona 5 Strikers is really worth the pick up. \n\nFinished it with all achievement done and would do it again. I might just come back for it for a merciless run but as of right now the show\u2019s over \ud83d\ude0a highly recommend. Thanks, you Koei, Omega Force, Sega and Atlus for bringing such a masterpiece over to the west.  Now where is my persona 5 strikers 2 because I crave please, persona 4 or 3 strikers anyone?",

        "content": "Initial Thoughts/The Story: Firstly, let me say this game is absolutely incredible! It's a fantastic follow up to vanilla Persona 5. And if you haven't had the chance to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then you can pretty much jump into this game semi-blind, there are a few things spoiled but nothing too major I'd say. I didn't think this game would be all that great when it was first announced but after playing it and beating it today, I can say it's a lot better than I anticipated. Especially as this is technically a spin-off. I can confidently say that this game is the best possible sequel to Persona 5 we could receive. Atlus and Koei Tecmo really out did themselves.\n\nThe combat/gameplay: Gone is the Confidant/Social Link system from previous main Persona games and in their stead comes a story progressed system. The game does not overload you with confidants and stats to raise (which in my opinion is a great thing!) as the game progresses with the story and doesn't move on until you're ready, so you can spend what would be considered two separate days in Persona 5 just grinding in the jails as Persona 5 Strikers will not move on until the next day until you're ready and have finished what you want for that day. Next are the Bond Skills. These essentially replace confidant abilities and offer so much variety in gameplay. You can invest your points into skills that: increase your health and sp (something I seriously recommend for later on in the game), allow you to crack open safes that contain decent loot, increase your physical and magical attacks, allow your allies to heal you from alignments, and more! These bond points are a welcomed feature in my eyes! Now for the big thing: the new combat system. I must say, I haven't played a warriors-styled game until now but I am pleasantly surprised with the results. Gone is the JRPG turn-based combat system. You now have to partake in essentially horde/wave battles, something I think fits the Persona series quite well. You get to wreak loads of havoc, unleashing powerful and swift attacks onto oncoming hoards of mindless shadows. I especially love how time freezes when you're using your personas, it gives you plenty of time to plan out your attacks and make sure you utilise the best skills possible. I really like the new combat system and honestly believe the Persona series should utilise this going forward. Showtime attacks are also a feature (I think I may prefer the Royal showtime attacks however), they don't do much damage initially to bosses later in the game, however there is a bond skill that increases the amount of damage that showtime attacks does (something I seriously recommend you invest your points in).\n\nNew Characters: I know for a fact I'm not the only one who wishes this game followed Royal's timeline rather than vanilla's, but the absence of Akechi and Sumire are made up for with the two new party members of this game: Sophia and Zenkichi. I can say without a doubt, these two characters are great additions, they're so comedic and powerful additions to the Phantom Thieves. If I'm being honest, I prefer how these two characters were handled and implemented into the story rather than how Atlus dropped the ball with Sumire in Royal. They flow really well into the story and their eventual arcs are intriguing all the way. Not to mention they provide a unique sense of freshness for the already established cast. All the characters work well off each other and you can tell they've grown even closer during Joker's six month absence. Sophia is a more cutesy addition whereas Zenkichi is the more comedic addition. As I have previously mentioned, both new characters are fantastic additions to the PT cast and I hope to see them return in an eventual Persona 5 Arena game or even another P5 related spin-off.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, no game is absolutely perfect, this game does have some striking (no pun intended) issues. The game crashed for me around three times in total, mainly during the end of the second jail, specifically when I had finished the trauma cell (so just be careful about that as you may experience this issue for yourself and lose some progress). Next is an issue where some of the keys decided to stop functioning. There is a simple fix for this issue: simply just press the windows key and go out the game and go right back in. Even though this was easy to fix, it was still a hindrance, especially as it happened during the final boss! Although this isn't an issue that has affected me, some people are reporting that some of the characters voice's differ in audio quality, I personally couldn't tell the difference and thought the audio sounded perfect for everyone. I do understand some people may be able to tell considering the voice lines were recorded at the actor's homes using a kit provided to them. But like I said, I couldn't tell the difference so it doesn't effect me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Finally, I bought the digital deluxe edition of this game so I could play it early, and my playtime ended in a whopping 60:04 hours. It took me a little longer than maybe some other players as I decided to really focus on the side requests/activities. I fought many bosses multiple times to grind for money and xp (I recommend the Seth fight if you want to farm an easy 10k xp) and just really focused on the requests (something I never expected I'd do). I also spent a lot of my time going for most of the achievements, some are locked behind Post-Game and NG+. I managed to get most achievements I wanted and they were actually fun to get, none of them were too annoying and required a lot of patience to get. So I'm sure trophy hunters will be pleased to here this. The story is phenomenal and really is Persona 5 2, I cannot recommend this game enough to existing Persona fans and newcomers to the series, if you want to experience something P5 related but can't get any of the main games, GET THIS ONE! It's such a joy to play thought, the characters, the world, the gameplay, and especially the music! Lyn and Lotus Juice once again knock it out of the park with the amazing songs that are in this game. I am leaving this game with some of my favourite Persona songs: songs such as Daredevil and Counterstrike are just phenomenal. If you haven't heard them yet I suggest looking them up on Youtube. I love, love, love, love this game's OST and think it's one of the best in the series (mainline and spin-offs included). If you're debating on purchasing this game, then as I die-hard Persona fan, I say go for it. Take the leap and just play this game. It's a wonderful experience. And whilst it may not be as long and as intricate as vanilla P5/Royal, it's still a fantastic experience even though it's half as long as vanilla P5. Definitely pick this game up. And I hope many more Persona games make their way to Steam so newcomers have more games to try to further push themselves into this fantastic series.\n\nScore: Pretty much expected if you've read all of my review so far but I'm going to give Persona 5 Strikers a perfect 10/10 (despite the cons I have previously listed). Please try this game if you ever get the chance it's an experience you do NOT want to miss. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to Atlus and Koei Tecmo for creating such a brilliant sequel to Persona 5.\n\n \n",

        "content": "I genuinely really like this game. It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.",

        "content": "Despite having some criticism of the game, overall I'm having a lot of fun playing it.\n\nGoing into the game I heard it was a cross between Dynasty Warriors and Persona. Playing it feels like neither.\n\nCombat itself is similar to Dynasty Warriors but lacks the feeling of big epic battles. Instead of large scale battles you have fixed encounters as if you were exploring a palace in persona 5. The combat is supposed to be fast paced but a lot of the time you end up opening menus to cast spells or switch your persona.\n\nA lot of what you'd expect in a Persona game is here but parts of it feel empty and missing. You have most the systems you'd except like fusing and elemental weakness and resistances however there are no social links. In fact there's not much socializing at all in this game.\n\nThere's a bond meter with the Phantom Thieves as you play through the game and clear side quests but that's about it. If you were hoping to see a large cast of returning characters it's a bit disappointing. All the Phantom Thieves are here and I did get to go for ramen with Ryuji but personally I always found the non-playable characters more interesting.\n\nOverall the game feels very Persona lite, hits a lot of what I want but is unsatisfying in some ways. If you're looking for Persona 5-2 this is not that game. If you just want to hang out with the Phantom Thieves again this game scratches that itch.",

I have a 1070 and probably didn't help that I was streaming it)\n\nOverall so far, I'm liking that time isn't restricted in this game. It goes by progression. Stamina (pretty much the SP) can drain pretty quick so going to checkpoints or the entrance of the metaverse will help a lot. Leave, shop if you need to, go back, all healed up. Music is great and gameplay seems alright depending on the characters you use with their different attack combos. Seeing \"show time\" and all out attacks in real time is a pretty neat thing to look at too.",

I really hope Atlus continues on this path for the Persona series. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy turn based as much as any fan of that combat system, but having free range of movement while also being able to still obtain new persona's, summon current persona's, has been a great way to enjoy combat scenarios. \n\nLike any JRPG there is some repetitiveness, but I don't mind that, and I honestly don't think any fan of JRPG's should, as this is something we've done for however many years we've (fans of JRPG's) been fans of this genre. I'm enjoying the story, and I've basically put every game on the shelf until I complete this. \n\nI won't go into depth detail, because frankly, I'm not great at that. What I can do is give you my recommendation for this game tho. I am not disappointed with my purchase, and I can't wait to see how it ends. So happy to have the Phantom Thieves back with a new game.\n\n-Phantom Thief Shinya",

It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves in a manner perhaps even more stylish than the original game.  You get to bond with each of your team mates, engage in various side quests, go on excursions, fight to soul-stirring music (at 60FPS), and take on a threat to the world as you go on a road trip around Japan.  What's not to like?  Unfortunately, as of this writing (in early March 2021), the game is plagued by persistent crashing on my system accompanied by occasional random slowdowns.  I save every change I get so I won't lose progress.  Hopefully they'll get these kinks worked out because I love this game.",

The game will probably make less sense for people who aren't familiar with the original Persona 5, but the gameplay is still solid regardless. \n\nThere are a lot of QoL changes made in Strikers that just weren't there in the original Persona 5, some to accommodate the new Dynasty-Warriors type combat, while others are just generally nice changes (such as no punishment for returning to the real world from the Metaverse). \n\nOverall if you've played the original Persona 5 and don't mind the switchup in the core combat loop, I highly recommend this game. If you haven't played the original Persona 5, you can still enjoy this game for what it's worth but you may miss out on references made to the original game.",

Also, there's no social aspect to the game no stats, no confidants, nough problem? \nNow speed round\nStory good, but ending is...similar to persona 5's end.\nCombat is good, but easily broken with 99 luck and mudo/hama with a mudo/hama boost. At least for mobs.\nNo romance... HOW DARE YOU!!!\nCharacter well Ryuji must have joined the navy because he's cursin like a sailor otherwise new characters are fine, and old characters are consistent.\nGame overall? Well i think it's a  fun concept that needs more polish. I would enjoy seeing another game like this more in line with the classic confidant system, some better \"levels/dungeons\", and be a little more polished combat wise.\nShould you buy this game? Yes, if you're fine with royal not being a thing, turn based combat being booted, and no confidant/social/romance system. It is a genuine good time, and i would recommend it.",

I loved every second of this game and I can't wait for the next game (pls 3d fighting game) which will hopefully have Sumi, Akechi, Zenkichi and Sophia. Must play for anyone even if you haven't played the original persona 5 or royal.",

Baton passes, 1 more attacks and all out attacks are all still there, even fusing new personas and collecting them from combat.\n\nOverall if you enjoyed Persona 5 and/or Persona 5 Royal (this is a sequel to just base 5 though i believe), its well worth a buy if you don't like musou style games maybe wait till it goes on sale and give it a try, I'm having a blast so far.",

        "content": "Great game , terrible pc port. \nThis review is here to inform you about the current state of the PC PORT and not so much about the actual game.\n\nSo I'm about to fill you in on a few things. First I really like this game , it has that good fast combat and the music is great , just like p5r and the idea of going around Japan with the gang is just awesome.\nThere is alot of good stuff that I can say about this game but I'm going to stop right here as I'm mostly interested in the current state of the pc port.\n\nSo..secondly what about the port? how is it?\nTo sum it up? just straight up  b a d .\n\nAs soon as you hit \"play\" you have to wait up to 5 or more minute for the game to load, that is IF it does anything at all. ( stuck on infinite loading screen , number 1)\n\nThis is a PC port and it does have Prompts for keyboard and mouse but you cannot have one key assigned to multiple actions , meaning that if you want to use the mouse to aim and shoot , you can`t do that. \n\nSay that you want ot aim with right click and shoot with left click.\nYou can aim with right click if it has nothing assigned to it but you cannot use left click to shoot if you have attack(melee) assigned to it already.\n\nAlso in this game when you move the camera  your character is also moving , if you use mouse it then, feels very clucky.\n\n-I`m going to list the other problems.\n\n-Some settings will not change until you also change the resolution of the game.\n\n-Once you finish the 5th jail (dungeon) you will get a black screen unless you play in borderless. ( for some playing in borderless causes bad frames) This is the second time you get an \"infinite loading screen\"\n\n-This game is also crashing a lot. This is not because of pattern or anything like that. It just stops working at random times.\n\n-I had it set to 60fps and it ran at 60 but I also had horrible screen tearing. So I decided to try and lock the game at 30fps from the config menu. My game still runs at 60fps but I no longer have screen tearing.\n\nBased on what I just wrote above, I have concluded that I cannot recommend P5S on PC in its current form.\nThis is a GREAT game with lots of fun to be had but the port nullifies all of that by being half-baked.\n",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers is a good game[/h1]\n[h1]But wait for a sale[/h1]\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n- All original voices are back (at least in English).\n- New characters are good and feel natural to the P5 world.\n- Persona collecting somehow still works despite the change in the combat mechanics.\n- New locations and dungeons look great.\n- Story doesn't completely suck despite it being a spinoff game.\n- Zenkichi is best girl\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Strikers a lot. The characters talking with each other felt as natural as it did in 5/Royal. Having the gang travel Japan was also a good decision, as it meant not being stuck in Tokyo the entire time (which they could've very easily done if they wanted).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-From a story standpoint, Royal is never mentioned. At all. Also, all non-party confidants (except three) never appear in the game.\n-Game reminds you of romances, but doesn't actually care what you chose.\n-Game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to switch up party members, but still forces some party members in some select fights.\n-Game isn't difficult (especially if you find the right item/bond build that allows you to mow over anything in the game).\n-Lack of combo depth.\n-Music is mostly P5 ost remixes with some new stuff (and overall, not as good as the original).\n-Where is Igor?\n-Play with a controller.\n-Story doesn't understand it's own universe's rules.\n\nTo expand upon the last point, there are two times the game contradicts their own rules. First, in the first dungeon, it's shown that, besides the party, people enter the Jails as their shadows. However, the game breaks this rule several times, and doesn't explain why.\nThe second major gaffe: Morgana mentions at the very end of the game that its the \"surprise of receiving a calling card\" that causes Desires to manifest, similar to Treasures. This is just a flat wrong explanation of how the calling cards work from both P5/Royal, as well as from the same game.\n\nAs to the other points, the combat is basic and easy, and there are ways to break it (hint: Two things break shields. weaknesses and criticals) which makes combat a joke. I used Yusuke the entire game and wasn't really punished for it, which shouldn't be ok in a game that emphasized elemental affinities.\n\nIf you can get over these somewhat minor gripes, the game is fun. I would only recommend it if it gets a price cut or sale though.",

        "content": "After a whole playthrough of the game, I can say that I really enjoyed P5S. There were some flaws, of course, but for the most part, it was nice to see the Phantom Thieves back in action.\n\nHere's some Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Remixed music, including new tracks with vocals by Lyn Inaizumi\n-Dual Audio (It's there if you want it. I'll stick with muh English)\n-Familiar stylish UI\n-Personas' properties (weaknesses/strengths/etc) are the same\n-The game is a sequel and makes references to P5 Vanilla (Royal's 3rd Semester was not canon)\n-The \"musou\" combat is delegated to a per-encounter basis. Ambush/Get detected by a wandering shadow, then more shadows pop out in a closed off area. Defeat, then move on.\n-Stealth in a musou game. Who'd a thunk it?\n-This game is Persona first, Musou second.\n\nSome things to note:\n-Game has a tendency to crash on loading screens (possibly due to DRM)\n-Due to it being a sequel, it will contain some spoilers for P5\n-Since P5R was not canon, Kasumi is not playable\n-Story can also seem a bit underwhelming compared to 5, and not as long\n-The DLC Personas of 5 are, of course, missing (they were DLC, of course)\n-No social links [Replaced by Bond System. This gives you access to an array of perks, kind of like talents]\n-Must beat game first to unlock Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal battle themes (\"Last Surprise\"/\"Take Over\"), unlike the methods for Switch/PS4\n-The system for jumping to pillars, chandeliers, etc is a bit awkward and can catch you mid-combo\n-If the English voice track feels blemished or sounds off, the VAs recorded out of studio during the pandemic. It sounded fine to me with headphones on.\n\nThat said, most of the Cons are mild gripes. Except the crashing, but I blame that more on the DRM than I do the game.\n\nBut if you really want to see what the Thieves are like in action combat (which was pretty fitting for the cast), give it a try.",

        "content": "I would say an 8.5/10. Great game, but I've had my own wave of emotions playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, the game plays almost nothing like a normal musuo game. This is *very* Persona feeling, it's just not turned based. Taking advantage of elemental weakness is still EXTREMELY important (like every persona game) and I find myself rarely combo-ing normal enemies and only using it during bosses. Once you have SP items available the combat feels more like Persona 5 completely. Combo-ing becomes near useless.\n\nMy thoughts on the story and dungeon designs, I think the first half of the game is considerably better than the end half. There's some depth that is skipped for the last half of the game that makes me feel like things were rushed, or it felt like they had to piece things together in the middle, like they knew what they wanted but needed something there. Especially the final area, it felt SUPER short if you compared it to the first or second. It surprised me how fast I got to the final boss.\n\nI don't know what people mean, I've only ever crashed once while playing the entire game. If you're crashing that often I honestly think your computer just can't handle the game? The game is well optimized in my opinion. The only other issue I had was my controller while playing registered A B and X all as the same input. I had to assign my controller on steam and that fixed it.",

        "content": "I would give this a neutral review if I could and rate it a generous 3/5. It isn't bad but it also does nothing good. This is a spin off of the original Persona 5 release and really only performs well at giving more screen time to the cast. You could play this without first playing Persona 5 but it would be pretty pointless. The story isn't that good and neither is the gameplay. You are here for the cast you wouldn't even know. This also does not follow Persona Royal and the new character from that version is not here.\n\nNone of the side characters from Persona 5 are in the game outside of Sojiro at the very start and end of the game. None of your favorites from the social links return at best you might get one line of internal monologue from Joker acknowledging their existence. One other character does show up for maybe 10 lines and that's it. \n\nSocial links themselves do not exist. Bonding points are here which you can use to level up skills that unlock during the main story. It's basically just a bar that goes up from pretty much anything you do without the main reason we did social links in the first place. Romance does not happen here but there are two bonding points in the game. But they are quickly forgotten and never mentioned again. \n\nThe story is average at best. Basically a rework of Persona 5 with more changing of hearts. If you've ever played a JRPG or watched anime you likely can see where it is going. Entirely forgettable and just an excuse to bring the cast back together. This could be more forgiven if the gameplay was great but...\n\nThe Shin Megami Tensei series perfected turn based combat many years ago with the Press Turn system. Persona 5 being an actual spin off of the main series uses a modified system of it. Strikers throws out all of that for an action system combined with musou elements. The main issue is it is incredibly repetitive and gets boring quickly. Each character has a few basic combos, their gun and their persona abilities. They also each learn 4 arts from continuing to use them further making them more useful and unique. But the kicker is you are now using all this up against the musou style of gameplay with tons of waves of enemies. It starts interesting but quickly overstays its welcome. Regular mobs are fairly weak but mini and especially bosses are HP sponges. The weakness abuse/critical hits/technical hits all carries over but it just isn't much fun. After the second jail I lowered the difficulty from hard to easy just so I could see the story.\n\nThere are two new characters joining the cast. Both fit in nicely and enjoyed their dialogue during the story. They are even better in combat though. I would say they might be to good and you might not want to leave them out in favor of your past favorites.\n\nThere is no time management in this game so you can freely leave the dungeon at any point. But it is like no one bothered to play test the game. You can leave from any checkpoint to restore your HP/SP and even warp back to that same point. So why not just make the checkpoint restore these things without wasting our time leaving and coming back? SP itself is scarce at the start of the game. The further you go in the main story the more bond skills you unlock to increase ways of restoring it. But it should just naturally recover from using normal attacks.\n\nThe voice acting (Japanese at least) is great and so is the music. Several music remixes and I look forward to getting the OST. The game is just as stylish as Persona 5 from menus to the actual combat.\n\nThe PC port is not that great. I myself had three crashes in my near 32 hours but I hear some people had it way worse. The graphical options are bugged and you'd need to tweak them outside of the game. Also the game is locked at a max 60 fps but the cutscenes run at 30 fps which is very noticeable.",

        "content": "Game is good, first time I've found the musou genre vaguely compelling! Port is rubbish: 3 to 4 minutes to start the game every time (as in, staring at a black screen for said several minutes before even the LOADING ICON appears), long load times during the game proper (15 to 20 seconds), which according to some sites: apparently stem from having installed DLC and Digital Deluxe Content. So don't buy those if you want manageable load times. In my case though, loading is still exactly as slow even after removing the DLC and uninstalling from HDD reinstalling the game unto my SSD. \n\nOn a whim, I heard that downgrading the drivers to your video card might help matters, so I decided to log into GeForce Experience; and before I started downgrading I started up the game and this time the game loaded in TEN SECONDS! Excited, I exited the game and started it again, hoping that solved the problem but nope. It was back up to 3 to 4 minutes of black screen before the game loaded again. What the hell? What the ACTUAL hell? Everything was literally the same when I started the game both those times in that short span of time. Why.\n\nI'm not the only one with this problem, and there are many others with various issues regarding crashing after long dungeons and the like. These issues/bugs may be address by a patch in the future but for right now: literally play any other version of Persona 5 Strikers instead of this one.",

I cannot tell you where to get the denuvoless .exe however but after applying the exe, it brings the exe size down from 331,000kb to only 38,000kb and might fix some technical issues for you.\n\nall in all, fun game.",

Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

Truly worthy of being called a Persona 5 sequel. \n\nUnfortunately, that's utterly irrelevant when the PC port is in such a shotty state. The game will randomly freeze up with no pattern or apparent cause--usually it'll recover on its own but even then you'll often have to wait minutes. It didn't happen to me in the first 10 or so hours, but ever since it's been happening with increasing frequency to the point that it's unplayable now. Tragic.\n\nThere are also other minor issues like DS4 rumble not working, analog inputs being snapped to the cardinal directions, a 60 FPS cap, blurry fonts at 4k, and settings that don't work without a restart (with no indication). \n\nSave yourself the hastle and buy the PS4 version (the Switch version does not run well, but that's a review for another day).",

P5S prioritised the combat, rather then the social aspects of the game and broke the tradition of Persona by giving it an Hack n Slash styled combat system - and it worked well. It feels different in a good way but it still feels like Persona 5 with weapons and personas, fusions, items etc.\n\nThe story was just as good as Persona 5 and it was the perfect addition to the Persona 5 storyline.\n\nTo whether your an Persona 5 fan, or just starting the series, the game is for you but I highly recommend you play Persona 5 first anyway to understand the lore about the cognition, characters, etc.",

        "content": "One word of caution: this game has crashed at least once for me, and the game does not autosave. Use every opportunity to save \u2014 save at every checkpoint, and save every time you have free time.\n\nOther than that, this game is fantastic. I've only [i]watched[/i] a playthrough of Persona 5 since I never owned a PS4 so I can't speak for how the game feels compared to P5, but I'm enjoying the hell out of this one. It might be a spin-off or a side story, but it's a good one. Instead of the usual Persona-style combat, battles are replaced with fast paced, small-scale Dynasty Warrior fights, and the battle music has been remixed to match. For everything else: the characters, the music, the style, the writing; it's all there. \n\nWell, almost. It's still a spin-off. There's no social links for example; during the free time segments, all you really do is walk around, shop for items and maybe talk to some party members for some basic dialogue, but nothing like in the main Persona games. That said, it's still an amazing game in its own right, as long as you don't expect a [i]true[/i] sequel.\n\nOf course, if you've never played or otherwise experienced Persona 5, this game will feel alienating as you're missing huge parts of the story and the characters. Here's hoping the success of this game will prompt a proper PC version of Persona 5 Royal so more people can enjoy this.",

        "content": "This game is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nI will start by saying that the Persona series is one of my favorite game series of all time, so it's not super surprising that I love this game. I was concerned at first that it was going to be more musou than Persona (as in, mostly focused on the combat rather than the story), but thankfully those concerns were immediately alleviated upon booting up the game. I'm not a huge musou fan, and I don't think I've ever unlocked New Game+ in a game that required you to do a bunch of extra stuff before, but I loved this game so much that I did every single quest and every single thing to unlock New Game+. The story really draws you in, and seeing all of the characters I love so much again made me so incredibly happy. I absolutely cried during the ending credits. \n\nThe only issue I have with this game is the crashing -- I noticed it always happens for me on loading screens, and it can be extremely frustrating. Make sure you save as often as possible. Other than that, I have zero complaints. I love all of the new characters, the story, the music, the locations, the aesthetics, the cutscenes, everything. In fact, I love it so much that I started a new game immediately after completing everything in my first run! If you love Persona 5, this sequel is absolutely worth it. If you don't like musous, you can play on easy mode so you can just experience the story!\n\nNow PLEASE bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam, Atlus!!!",

While I initially had my doubts and worried this would be just a Musou-kind cash grab, it feels a lot more like Persona 5-2 would be like. The quirky characters, the second to none soundtrack and having a peek at more cities in Japan are all super enjoyable. If you've been to Japan, you'll immediately recognize Kyoto, Osaka, Okinawa and many more locations!\n\nThe battle system can be a bit tricky in the beginning (and very lengthy towards later bosses), but it rewards skills and planning, which is an additional metric to perceive progress in the game.\n\nDuring my playthrough, the game only crashed once. I lost 15 minutes of progress, so make sure you'll save at every opportunity you have just in case.\n\nI only feel sorry that this is a game that can be only fully appreciated by gamers who played Persona 5, it's sad that there is no port available just yet. \n\nDefinitely recommended!",

So unless there's a legitimate optimization patch, which the hotfix didn't seem to help here, I suggest you go for the Switch or PS4 version instead.",

P5S feels great to be back into the world of Persona alone let alone the refreshing combat that gives it a new feel and twist. The characters are the same lovable idiots we grew with through P5 and seeing them again is awesome, added with a few new people and its a fantastic dynamic. If you have played any other persona game you know the music is great and the way they personas work in this new combat feels natural. \n\nPS: Hard mode is really hard at the start and well worth the challenge if your like me and hate yourself\n\nEdit: 45 hours and I finished the game, 9.5/10 I bought it for 75$ and id happily spend that again",

In the beginning, it's an absolute visual overload with a ton of crap happening on screen. But as you learn the mechanics and the characters, you really get into the  game. Only thing I would say is if you're gonna buy this game on PC, it is best played with a controller. Keyboard and mouse is pretty wonky and while it's playable, the combat is SO MUCH more satisfying on a controller",

And if you have the extra music pack, that just ADDS more to it. \n\nThe combat is fastpaced, and the difficulty of each encounter just becomes more fun.  (Despite... some issues)\n\nThe story in this game matches Persona 5's, as this spinoff follows the aftermath of P5S. \n\n| The Bad\n\nThe scaling of HP of basic trash mobs seems... excessively high. And that's just basically it. \n\nI am NOT a fan of how many skills that stop you from moving. Specifically, it feels like Bufu/Zio, and the certain debuffs that stun you, need to be nerfed in effectiveness. Also, FUCK YOUR COUCH, Sleep. \n\nAnd the biggest elephant in the room?\nThe crashing. \n\nYeah, no. This game has a powerful crashing fetish. \nAnd the stutters become evident in the game...\n\n\n|The Rating\n\nWhile the game has it's flaws, the characters are charming, the combat is exciting, and in general the game feels difficult without being cheap. \n\nMy rating is Four Stolen Desires out of five.",

The combination of Persona gameplay and Musou gameplay blend so well. For people who are not used to Musou game, they maybe will find a hard time to keep up with all the stuff happening on the screen.\nAlthough we can't get every aspect from Persona, i think this game has enough to satisfy me. The soundtracks are banger as usual, especially the new ones.\n \nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers is a solid game. 9/10",

[spoiler] Meaning Kasumi does not exist in this game, Atlus please add her as a DLC later maybe. :) [/spoiler] With a new threat posing the world, the thieves are reunited together to kick some more ass.\n\n[b]Persona 5: Strikers[/b] introduces a new hack-and-slash combat system to give the series a fresh take. As Atlus always delivers, there is also incredible UI transitions, music compositions, and stories to explore in the world. By buying the Deluxe Edition, you will be granted access to the digital interactive artbook, soundtrack, and some behind-the-scenes making of Striker's music- on top of that, you will also receive some bonuses in-game to aid you in your battles.\n\n[spoiler] SPOILER ALERTS: Do NOT peek at the artbook until you're finished with the game, the artbook contains spoilers. The opening cinematic to the game also contains a tiny portion of spoilers, in case you're wondering about that. [/spoiler]\n\nThis game will have you traveling across several cities and towns based in Japan. You will meet new faces, discover hidden treasures, find an abundance of different shops to buy a variety of items from, and clear \"Jails\" (which are pretty much a twisted variation of the old \"Palaces\", you will find out more about them in the game).\n\nAll-in-all, if you are looking to expand your knowledge of the Persona universe, or you just want to beat up a bunch of shadows and bosses, this game is likely for you. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nBelow are my own opinions about the game after clearing through the game and having 100+ hours of experience. Currently on my way to 100%-ing the game's achievements. Whether you agree or disagree to my opinion(s) is all entirely up to you. I have a bias towards the Persona series, but I will try my best to be truthfully honest about this game.\n\n[h2] NEGATIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nWhile this game is overall really good, I can't say this game goes without having a few issues that comes with it straight out of the box. I'll get the negatives out of the way first.\n\n[list]\n[*] My biggest complaint are the random, constant game crashes as well as the infinite loading screens. No matter what you try to do, it seems you can't do anything to fix them. Playing full-screen or windowed-borderless mode causes them more frequently, so I usually play on windowed-mode. You can also try lowering the graphics, but I doubt that'd help. My only tip is to SAVE OFTEN- YOU WILL CRASH. Until they send out a patch to fix these crashes, save often because there is no autosave. I've lost a few hours of progress due to this, the same goes to my friend who's had more crashing issues than me.\n\n[*] Keyboard controls and assisted-aiming feels really clunky. I've played on both keyboard and gamepad, the controls still feel somewhat clunky but once you adjust it should feel fine. The target assistance in the game feels really off, Sometimes I want to ambush a certain enemy, but it ambushes an entirely different enemy. Or even when I want to lock onto a rail to ride on it, I end up doing something completely different.\n\n[*] The anti-aliasing option seems... odd? Not sure how to describe it, but I just left it as it is. Some people might have a problem with it depending on your graphics card.\n\n[*] The DLCs aren't really worth buying separately. You can easily grind the content you get from the DLC. Either buy the Deluxe edition and don't look back, or buy the regular game and play it as it is. Trust me, you'll be fine either way.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] POSITIVES ABOUT THE GAME [/h2]\nFinally, the positives about the game. There really is a large amount of positives I want to point out from the game, but I'll try to tl;dr it.\n\n[list]\n[*] The storyline is how you expect it to be from a Persona game. You'll be going along for a roller-coaster ride of plot twists, fun and sad moments. You'll easily get attached to some new characters as well. While the gameplay experience isn't as long or sophisticated as the original Persona 5 game, you will still get a nice feeling of satisfaction after clearing the story.\n\n[*] As I mentioned earlier, Atlus feeds us yet another game full of art-beloved UI transitions and new musical compositions. If you love Persona for what it is, you'll love this game. Expect to be jamming to Persona music for a while.\n\n[*] While the battle system has changed into a hack-and-slash style from the original turn-based system, I can say for certain that this is a completely new breath of fresh air. Even by saying it's just a hack-and-slash is not fair to this game, there's much more to it that you'll explore. I actually prefer this over the original combat system. It's just full of constant action and doesn't feel boring at all.\n\n[*] END GAME CONTENT- MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: While there is no clear end-game story, additional content comes in the form of New Game+; essentially you can start a new game with all of your stats carrying over to the new game. You can also opt in to try out Merciless mode, the hardest difficulty of Strikers there is. Once you start Merciless mode, you can't back out. There is also some content you can only unlock in New Game+, so you'll have to play through the game at least twice to unlock all the achievements if you're looking to do that. It feels really nice beating bosses at maximum difficulty.\n\n[*] Each Jail is unique- unlike Palaces from previous games. Every jail you visit will feel fresh, as they're designed to be a new experience from other jails. Each one will have its own atmosphere and aesthetic. Play the game for yourself to find out how different Jails are from Palaces.\n\n[*] You are able to switch between the Phantom Thieves and play as Makoto, Haru, Ann- hell even Morgana. Each thief has their own playstyle. Mix and match your party and find out which strategy works for you! (note: you can't play as Futaba, she's a support character for obvious reasons yet again)\n\n[*] Flashy all-out attacks and showtimes are still present. You will feel like a bad-ass performing these while Last Surprise plays in the background.\n\n[*] PERSONA ON PC!?!?!?!?!? One step closer to Persona becoming the norm for PC gaming.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2] GAME RATINGS [/h2]\n\nControls: 6 / 10 - 7 / 10 if you're on controller\nGameplay: 8.5 / 10\nStoryline: 10 / 10\nMusic: 11 / 10\nWaifus: too powerful to rate\n\nbought the game 3 times for pc + switch, as well for a friend. worth.\n\n[h2] CONCLUSION [/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[i]tl;dr[/i] [b] game good, but please add royal to steam, I have too much free time.[/b]\n\nThat concludes my review of Persona 5: Strikers. Good luck out there, fellow thieves-\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Hello everyone who reads this,\nThe Warriors/Musou-series playstyle was implemented pretty well and with series thoughts and not just added.\nBecause of that I have the feeling the essence of a good Persona game was still there even if the gameplay changed due to that.\nThere are some parts that seem strange when you fight against certain enemies and you get the feeling you cannot do anything just keep in mind that the those have weaknesses as well.\nAll in all a really good game and for fans of the series I suggest to give it a try since it is not just blindless button mashing(even though I like those every now and then).\nI also suggest to start with the normal difficulty and not higher right of the bat ;).",

        "content": "Its Persona!\n\nThis game has a very heartfelt spot to my life. Persona was honestly my first JRPG and is what got me hooked to other games of that genre ever since. I unfortunately started with Persona 4 Golden for the PS vita (wish I played this franchise earlier) which then got me to P5 for the PS4 and now P5S for the PC. I feel pretty fancy getting to play different persona games on different platforms.\n\nOverall, if you like persona or JRPGs in general.. This is a must buy. However be warned, I do recommend playing P5 or P5R before diving into Strikers. It is an exact sequal to where P5 left off and rarely is a sequal that does benefit from playing the previous title. As P5 or P5R will introduce you to each character traditionally which makes the inside jokes and connection to each character that much more meaningful.",

With the story, voice acting, cut-scenes and more, it feels closer to a Persona 5 sequel than a standard Mousou game, especially compared to most of the Warriors' crossovers.  The combat is engaging and carries a lot of the Persona feeling considering the fast-paced action style.  Very happy with it; very occasional random crashes can get really irritating (especially on Merciless now) but it's the only bug I've experienced, and is otherwise a solid game.  Hopefully they can find and squash it :)",

        "content": "Another PC port from ATLUS! It's always great to see!\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a really unique spin on the Persona series. It takes the awesome world and characters of Persona 5 and mashes it with a real time combat system similar to the Hyrule Warriors series. I came into this game thinking I would be spamming my primary attack button to win, but was pleasantly surprised that it is far more diverse and dynamic than that. The way they crossed the Persona fusion system with all the Persona abilities with the Warriors battle system works so well and makes it way more engaging.\n\nWhile I have not completed the entire story yet, what I have seen so far makes me feel like I never stopped playing Persona 5. The characters' stories and the voice acting is still the same greatness from Persona 5 and it really almost feels like a true sequel to the game. Definitely would recommend to anyone who has played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nMy only gripe with this game.. is the PC Port. Unfortunately, Koei Tecmo was involved in the development of this game, meaning the PC Port is definitely gonna have some issues. For one, the game is capped to 60 FPS, which is an improvement compared to Persona 5 Royal's 30 fps, it is definitely disappointing there isn't a way to uncap the frame rate like in ATLUS's port of Persona 4 Golden. The anti-aliasing is also very lazy and makes the in-game menus look very blurry, and the character models will also look very aliasied unless you turn the Resolution Scale up to 2.0 (in my experience). The game still runs great, but the port itself still feels pretty lazy and feels like they didn't even try to adjust it for the PC like they did with Persona 4 Golden.",

        "content": "After eight hours of play I experienced my first crash. This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story. I'll give my final thoughts when I finish.",

        "content": "Absolutely worth playing through if you enjoyed Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back with a new story that's like if you take the road trip part of FFXV with Dynasty Warriors gameplay.\n\nIt's not as long as a typical Persona game but it's long enough to have an entertaining story with a great characters. I like the way they blended Persona gameplay elements with Dynasty Warriors gameplay, it works really well so you can't just spam attack or just personas. They also encourage you to take your time and try out every party member and not use just Joker as there is no deadlines either.\n\nI 100%ed the game and it took me about 44 hours to do so and I didn't rush through the game either so I'd say that's a good amount if you wanted more Persona 5 content.\n\n",

        "content": "Having finished it now i feel safe to write a short review.\n\nShort, if you like the Warrior Games and you like Persona, you will very likely enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat itself feels engaging. The enviroment is usable in fights (swinging from poles, dropping stuff on enemies), maybe too much. Some fights can be cheaped out this way, but for a majority its fine. The combat system feels very good, they managed to mix the ability system very well with the button mashing. All Strong attacks in some way connect with the current Persona (some cast their go-to spell, offers debuff after a 2 hit-combo with strong attack and so on) so its interesting to just test random ones to see if you like their abilites more. On that note be said, that not all Personas from PE5 made it into this game.\n\nThe full cast is playable and all of them feel unique enough to not be dull. All of them have their unique strengths though.\n\nThe story feels is okayish for a warriors spin off, there have been worse, but towards the ending [spoiler]it feels like they copied the persona 5 a little bit too much, but thats my personal opinion.[/spoiler] Seeing new places however and having more area to go around felt nice. The battlemusic is a really awesome remix thats even after the 20th battle still nice to hear. If you go deluxe edition you get basically every persona game OST covered in some way.\n\nCONS\nSome bosses felt like HP-Sponges, especially the optional ones. A lot of jumping around to not get 1-shotted by some aoe thing, while spending 15 minutes chipping down hp. I had the game crash at 3 different times in my play time, so im neutral to that (but i read there is people with massive crash problems, so idk, i guess i was lucky). And thats about it from me in that corner.\n\nWould i recommend the game?\nIf you dont know persona 5, and you dont know the warrior games, this might be a bad game to jump in.\nIf you only know for example Dynasty Warriors, the story might be confusing, i would recommend looking into Persona 5 and figure out for yourself if you would enjoy that.\nIf you are just a Persona Fan, i would go for it if you like action rpgs atleast.\n\n",

        "content": "As a fan of Persona 4 and 5, i cannot recommend this. Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored. If you like this kind of games - give it a shot.",

        "content": "This game isn't just some Dynasty Warriors reskin, it's not a Persona cashgrab, Persona 5 Strikers is a fully fledged sequel to the original Persona 5 with more than enough content to be thought of as a true persona game. After 100+ Hours in this game I can happily say this is another fantastic game by Atlus (and KT this time).\n\n[h1] MINIMAL STORY SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\n[b] Overview[/b]\nThe Phantom Thieves are back and they are prepared to journey across Japan. Strikers' world building feels great, even whist travelling from Tokyo to Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Kyoto, Fu.kuoka and Osaka in the space of 1 month and exploring jails as they go. Each city looks fantastic and are all very lively, an improvement on Persona 5. Though the combat may look a little intimidating to long time Persona fans it feels more at home with the actual combat the Phantom Thieves would go through. The beginning, middle and end of the game is consistently great and Atlus & KT gave a masterpiece such as Persona 5 a sequel it deserved.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\nThis time around the Phantom Thieves are tasked at exploring Jails across Japan, city-sized palaces ruled by some of the most powerful people in Japan. To fit the combat of Strikers, Jails are much larger than Palaces found in Persona 5 but are still filled with small details the can really grab your eye. A lot of enjoyment can be gained from just running around these Jails and mopping up shadows just for fun. \nAs I mentioned before the combat is rather different than your traditional SMT or Persona game, but the most pivotal mechanics are still used in Strikers. Every Phantom Thief has their original personas and skills but all have a unique playstyle for you to experience and decide on your 'main'. Joker still has his wildcard ability, but due to the lack of Igor in the velvet room he only has access to half the personas available in Persona 5. Their different weapons and guns make for a whole new experience depending on who you use, and their weapon actually changes in their hand if you buy a new one.\n[list]\n[*] [b] Joker[/b] - Access to all elements, fast attacks and an all-around beginners character\n[*] [b] Ryuji[/b] - Electric user, Slower bat attacks but do much more damage, focus on Physical skills and tanking\n[*] [b] Ann[/b] - Fire user, Fast whip attacks and fastest gun (Sub-Machine gun), focus on magic skills\n[*] [b] Morgana[/b] - Wind user, Fast sword attacks with a lot or aerial usage, mainly a healer\n[*] [b] Yusuke[/b] - Ice user, Normal sword attacks but with flurry combos, crit monster, focus on Physical attacks\n[*] [b] Makoto[/b] - Nuclear user, Normal fist attacks, all around nuclear powerhouse, an all-around character\n[*] [b] Futaba[/b] - Navigator, non-playable but can provide buffs, healing and protection for the team.\n[*] [b] Haru[/b] - Psy user, Very slow axe attacks but with very high damage, focus on gun attacks and combo skills\n[*] [b] Sophia[/b] - Bless user, Fast Yo-yo attacks with a Rhythm mechanic, high-skill based character but can be used as a healer[/list]\n\n[b] Overworld[/b]\nThe lack of 'daily life' of this game may put off a few from picking this game up, but the amount of interaction in the overworld decently makes up for it's absence. Every city has many NPCs to interact with and all shopkeepers have their own dialogue (and there are a lot of shops). After progression in the story the Phantom Thieves may be standing around town with dialogue of their own [strike] unfortunately it is not voiced[/strike]. They may also hand you requests which furthers the level of interaction you get from your long time allies. Every city looks vastly different from the next with their very own top tier theme, which really helps set each city apart from another. \n\n[b] Music[/b]\nC'mon, it's a Persona game, you should know by now that is has fantastic music, and this game is certainly no exception. From the opening theme all the way till the credits song, in my opinion there is no bad or even mediocre track in the entire soundtrack. Every song fits the theme it requires and makes you want to explore each area in depth just to listen to the smooth Jazz. Speaking of which, p5's Jazz theme has not disappeared, though there is a bit of a metal theme for the more intense battles, which fits the high paced combat perfectly. It's another fantastic job by Shoji Meguro, Lyn, and the whole Atlus sound team.\n\n[b] Graphics and Performance[/b]\nStrikers is a pretty good looking game, the art style of Persona 5 compliments the gameplay of Strikers, using the bold lines and bright colours doesn't get you lost in the fast-paced gameplay. The menu's are the best Persona has ever done, with smooth transitions and every character having a cameo in different sections of the menu. Unfortunately this game was also developed for the switch, which limited how far they could take the graphical aspect of the game. Also this PC port is not the greatest, the cause is unknown but on some systems certain cutscenes will crash the game if viewed in fullscreen. It isn't very well optimised either, enemies will lag out the game using Agidyne, and text looks grainy due to Anti-Aliasing. Overall this doesn't effect the experience too much but it is something to keep in mind if you are debating between buying Strikers on PC or PS4\n\n[b] Story[/b]\nThis is where Persona 5 Strikers really surprised me, as a spinoff I expected a toned down story filled with fanservice to keep the players happy but no. Strikers has a very 'persona-like' story, without the social links. Without a need to build characters (except the few new introductions) Atlus was able to fully focus on the story and make it great from the beginning until the end. The story starts a little weak but really picks up and is definitely on the level of a mainline Persona game story. Each new character fits perfectly into the story and each have their own role to play.\n\n[b] Characters[/b]\nSince this is a sequel to Persona 5 and not Royal, this game does lack Kasumi and any mention of Maruki, but the rest of the Phantom Thieves make their appearance with a new ally - Sophia, a sketchy detective -Zenkichi Hasegawa and an upbeat woman of tech - Kuon Ichinose.\nSophia is 'Humanity's Companion,' an AI Joker discovers in the depths of a Jail. Her main derivative is to learn, as she lost her memory after being dumped into this jail. She accompanies the Phantom Thieves in their trip, inside Joker's phone.  She's bright and bubbly and quite similar to Aigis from Persona 3.\nZenkichi is an employee of Public Security and has been tasked in researching the 'change of heart' epidemic that has swept across Japan. He may be a friend or foe but one thing is for sure, he'll be on your tail this whole trip.\nIchinose is a quirky tech guru that just loves her coding. She just happens to come across the Phantom Thieves and is a HUGE fan. She happily starts working with them to find the true culprit changing these hearts.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts[/b]\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game to pick up if you're a fan of Persona or hack n slash musou games in general. There is over 100 hours worth of gameplay (including postgame) and it never gets stale. Merciless provides a great challenge in New Game+ and lets you listen to the amazing soundtrack even more.\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10[/h1]",

        "content": "[h1] Is this game any good? [/h1]\n\nShort Answer: Yes\n\nLong Answer: Holy crap, the game starts out strong and reels you in with a strong start. The music, the visuals, and the combat.\n\n[b] The Combat [/b]\n\nThe combat is fun, all characters have their strengths and weaknesses. While some characters might be useful against certain types of enemies, they could also be vulnerable to other types of enemies. Every character also has their own unique moveset and combo list. \n\n[b] The Music [/b] \n\nThe music is beautiful, the combat themes, the city themes, the Jail/Dungeon themes. Most games always have an outstanding OST, but they are mainly grounded to big scenarios like boss fights, or alike. However, in this game the music is always charming and the smaller tracks are just as good as the bigger tracks.\n\n[b] The Issues [/b]\n\nThere is not much to complain about though there are a few mishaps.\nFor starters, there are a few times where the game crashes and since this game functions on a checkpoint and manual save system it is a bit distressing having to replay an a chunk of the game due to the game crashing.\n\nAlso a tiny thing is how every time you begin a battle the combat theme will begin playing, but as soon as you finish the fight and get into another the combat theme will play again from the beginning. Though this isn't all too annoying since this game is a spin off from the Persona series where having to hear the same combat theme is something that always happens, which makes this problem a minor one.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\n\n[b] Zenkichi best girl [/b]",

Shadows pop up in mob forms, and often mini bosses (strong shadows with health bars up top) come out to play, but hack n slashing won't get you far. You must use strategy to beat most enemies. Run n Gun with joker only got me to the 2nd jail (palace in this game). \n\nOverall it's fun, and aside from getting the deluxe edition to only allow me access to the bonus content on separate disk/download and can't install to my computer.\n\n",

Haven't had any crashes and the story is nice so far, especially if you want some more phantom thieves action.

Hopefully persona 5 royal comes to pc soon so everyone on pc can enjoy it because it is a masterpiece.",

        "content": "If you're already a fan of Persona 5 and you're itching for more, this title is worth your time.\n\nThis title oozes with the same style and poise that Persona 5 has. The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat. Especially since the majority of players of this game are likely Persona vets.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic JRPG not just because of how it tells a fantastic story with a set of loveable and memorable characters but also because of how it retains the feeling of playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. The Phantom Thieves, The Mind Blowing Eargasm Soundtrack, the Cinematic Show time and All out Attacks, the Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal design has been also given to Persona 5 Strikers from the layout to the games menu to the animations and cut scenes to the city of Japan to the dungeon which were formally known as Palaces in the meta verse now known as Jails. The Fantastic Story exploring the Meta verse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow while life in the real world goes on as the Protagonist and the rest of the Phantom Thieves are on Summer vacation when things start to go downhill. Persona 5 Strikers is as good as a Season 2 of Persona 5 Apart from missing a few signature system such as Social Links from past Persona games.\n\nStory and Game Structure: \nPersona 5 Strikers takes place and continues the story from Persona 5, just pretend Persona 5 Royal didnt happen and i have to pretend i did not romance Yoshizawa Kasumi the new girl from Persona 5 Royal which was not in Persona 5. Persona 5 Strikers continues to explore the world of the Metaverse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow. The Phantom thieves are back in action to return the desires that have been stolen to their owners while also problem solving the change of hearts not by done by them to the Citizens of Japan, while the threat of the Japanese Bureau persecuting the group looms around. Given how Persona 5 Strikers has been made to be a 2nd Season of Persona 5, it is impressive that it retains the feel and Atmosphere that Persona 5 has. \n\nThe most noteable change to Persona 5 Strikers is probably the confidance system and the velvet room, the velvet room changes make Persona 5 Strikers persona fusion much simpler but the loss of confidance system and side stories that accompany them is what diverges from what a propa Persona 5 Season 2 might be. Instead you gain bond points from fighting along side with the Phantom Thieves or real time events or cooking. While these bond points allowed me to unlock new passive skills and upgrade them, i miss hanging out with the indivisual members of the Phantom Thieves hanging out with them during free time and seeing their side  PeRsOnA-L stories. Not that i mind spending less than 10 000 hours on a Persona game but i can spend any amount of time hanging out with the Phantom thieves even if it means to stop playing other games\n\nCharacters, Soundtrack and Atmosphere:\nThroughout Persona 5 Strikers the Phantom Thieves travel to different locations not just in Japan around Tokyo but to Hokkaido and Okinawa during their summer trip plus investigations but also in the meta verse where combat takes place at. The Dugenons formally known as Palaces in Persona 5 and Royal are now known as Jails and they are large and can take hours to complete. Since the jails that you are fighting in transforms the city around you, travelling back and fourth from the Jails and the real world to stock up on items and replenish HP and SP without taking up time in the real world  from previous Persona games has been implemented in Strikers which makes. Exploring different parts of Tokyo and Japan is a lot of fun just like Persona 5 or Royal even if its for the simplest things such as stocking up on items. Both the Duengons and the Map of Persona 5 Strikers are well desgin and made to be memorable. \n\nThe fan favourite Phantom Thieves are back along side new addition Sophia (Rip Kasumi Yoshizawa from Persona 5 Royal) and i don't think there is any game that i have played that has any more memorable characters than those from the Persona 5 series, while also having different personalities they each have something that will make you fall in love with them. The voice acting and animations are also are very well done. Persona 5 Strikers sound track just like any other Persona game i have played is also mind blowing, memorable and just way too good that it gives me and Ear gasm whenever i am listening to it.\n\nCombat:\nPersona 5 Strikers introduce a totally different style in combat by making players stratagize the use of their Persona skills and other mechanics that were from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal such as the gun mechanics and the cinematic all out attacks and Show Time attacks. Fighting in Persona 5 Strikers feels good as it feels like im playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal using my Persona skills but also combo-ing skills with the Phantom Thieves that i choose to play as not to mention the different personallties of each character and variety of skills and combos they have. Making use of the enemys weakness in Persona 5 Strikers and using Persona skills is also a important aspect of Persona 5 Strikers as you will want to do enough damage to their weak point to use a All out or Show time attack especially against Bosses and higher level enemys since they usually have a large health pool and can soak up a lot of damage. Every Phantom Thieve in Persona 5 Strikers is playable and they each have different fighting styles and combos you can have up to 4 members of the Phantom Thieves in your party however Joker must be in the squad no matter who you choose to have along side with him. The strategy base mechanics such as using Persona Skills switching members of your party or switching the Phantom Thieve that your are currently playing as becomes even more important or harder difficulties.\n\nPros:\n-The Story of Persona 5 Season 2\n-Retains the Feel of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal\n-Real time combat with turn base mechanics such as Persona Skils etc while also carrying over Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal mechanincs such as Show-time attacks, Gun uasge and All out attacks etc\n-Mind Blowing Ear-gasm Soundtrack\n-Map and Duengon aka Jails Design\n-Voice Acting and Characters\n\nCons:\n-Occasional Crashes on patch 1.0\n-Unanswered answers for players yet to Play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal\n-No Confidance system\n-Slice of Life system from calander has been cut down\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers story is what a Persona 5 Season 2 might be making this summer vacation and road trip around Japan fun, memorable and loving for fans of Persona 5 and Royal but confusing for anyone new to it.  Persona 5 is one of my favourite JRPGS, it has a mind blowing soundtrack, its world is immersive and relatable filled with loveable and memorable characters and supporting characters alongside a really rich story. The only let down being the Confidance System and the Slice of Life Calander system from previous titles which was missing.",

        "content": "The original Persona 5 is my favorite JRPG of all time, so when I heard that it was getting a Warriors-style spin-off, I was interested but not super excited. I had played Hyrule Warriors and enjoyed it quite a bit but I thought it was lacking in the story department. As more information came out about Persona 5 Strikers (or Scramble: The Phantom Strikers as the fan base knew it before it was localized) it was revealed that it was actually a full-blown sequel to the original game in the style of an action RPG. Now, this was something I could get excited about!\n\nNow that I have finished it, I can say it is a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time. Sure, a lot of the social aspects are gone, but that isn't really what Strikers is about. Strikers is a hack and slash road trip for the beloved Phantom Thieves, so if you love P5's cast you'll feel right at home here. HOWEVER, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT PLAYING PERSONA 5. The game assumes you're familiar with the world of that game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by spoiling the plot of the original game. Seriously, either find a PS4 to play it or hold out a bit longer for a PC port.\n\nAs for the game itself, I found it plays more like Kingdom Hearts than Dynasty Warriors. The combat is fluid and brain-numbingly fun. Each character has unique quirks that make them exciting and fun to play as. Being able to switch between them at a moment's notice makes the combat constantly feel fresh. My only real complaint about the game is that some of the dungeons feel a little hollow, and I think the story leans too heavily into the themes of the first game. Atlus had the opportunity to do something really interesting here, and they do with the addition of some new characters. But a lot of the plot, especially near the end, feels like a retread.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of Persona 5 this is a must-buy. If not, go play the original game and come back to this. I promise you, the style, characters, and story of these games are so instantly loveable and well worth the time sink.\n\nUntil next time, Phantom Thieves.\n\n8/10",

It was fun, that's all i really have to say because there's not much to talk about because this feels like a sequel but at the same time it doesn't in a way where it feels like a different timeline, but what this game really shares is its moments no really big plot twists or story arks it just feels like a extended episode of a cancelled show but overall i really enjoyed this fun road trip with the gang even know there's two missing from it. I guess you could say it was a nice revisit to P5's world again.\n\n7/10       - ATLUS please Remake some of the Persona games",

Finally, Persona 5 strikers does have a con for me at least from the first 6 hours and this is that the level design is very bland but the design of the palace is great as always in persona games from the first palace but of course this could be subject to change as I get further into the game other than that I'd recommend Persona 5 Strikers.",

Expect shorter fights with enemies that are typically doing more offensive moves.",

It doesn't quite reach the level of Persona 5's story, but it's still up there on the story tiers. \n\nThe new music tracks in the game are also fantastic, including adding probably my most favourite new battle theme in the Persona series to date. [spoiler]Counter Strike[/spoiler]\n\nIt does seem to have some issues of crashing between load zones rarely and bouts of lag in cutscenes or large areas that tear the audio, though my processor is lower than minimum required so that may be more a me problem than the game. \n\nDespite those problems, I have thoroughly enjoyed what this game has offered. And as of now still have more content to finish up on it. [i]~34 hours of in-game playtime, many of my steam-tracked hours are idling with game on background.[/i]",

Don't believe me? check out the page for bugs on steam, and I'm talking about peeps with high end tech that their playing it on, having constant crashes. its ridiculous. and my 7.6 hours of play time? at least four of those hours where spent with just trying to retrace everything i just did in the palace before the last crash, and then id get a little further,  just for it to crash again. wait to buy this product until they resolve the issue of the crashing. There's no auto save in the palaces and you cant manually save whenever you want in the palaces, so unless you like doing every last thing from the last time you saved over and over again, until maybe, just maybe it doesn't crash, then yeah, go for it, get the game. Game play wise, it isn't that bad, really. Its fun, even though the combats not my favorite, but it still feels uniquely persona and that's all I really care about, same with the story, seems like a good old fashioned persona story, which I love... but please, just fix the crashes so I can figure out if the game was even worth the money I invested into it.",

Sophia is a fantastic addition to the Phantom Thieves and both her and Zenkichi are deeply fun to play alongside the existing roster of beloved characters. As with Persona 5, there's not a moment when I'm not excited to take on the next boss or reveal the next plot sequence. PHANtomTASTIC!",

I love getting to see the full cast together in more scenarios that's something that P5 felt lacking in, but here we get to have a wonderful adventure with them and 2 new interesting characters that don't hog the spotlight. It's a great game, well worth the time we had to spend waiting for it. I hope after SMT V we get same day international releases.",

        "content": "Strikers had a lot to live up to as a sequel to one of the best JRPGs of all time, but it somehow delivered. Even though it transitioned from a turn-based RPG to an action-based musou game, it still feels very much like Persona, with every gameplay staple intact. Weaknesses, technicals, elements, baton pass, and more; all wrapped up in a sexy and stylish art style and UI that's basically Persona 5's trademark. I often get bored of musou games very quickly because of it's extremely repetitive nature and simplistic combat, but Strikers does not have this problem at all since, like I mentioned, it has all of the gameplay staples you'd expect from a Persona game, which wildly varies the gameplay and always keeps you on your toes; especially if you play on higher difficulties. The SP system is also back where you can't recharge SP unless you return to the real world, or use items which are either expensive or hard to come by. This encourage you to constantly swap party members so you keep your gameplay variety fresh and entertaining (along with characters getting new passives or skills the more you play as them).\n\nThe only negatives I can really say about Strikers is that there is significantly less real-life activities to do. They are still there, and you can explore and talk to people, but the volume of stuff you can do is significantly lessened from P5. This is because you no longer have a time limit to complete your objective in the metaverse. If you never played Persona 5, this won't really mean anything to you, but to those who have played it, you probably should know that.",

        "content": "Highly recommend it. Playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal is not necessary to follow the story, but it does enrich the experience. The characters are fun as always - including the new ones - and the combat actually has a fair amount of depth to it. It uses a lot of the Persona from P5 in a sort of action-rpg type of way, slowing down time to allow the player to pick the correct ability. Also, each playable character has their own unique mechanics, so while you can switch freely between each character and know basically how to play them, there is definitely room to improve with them. All the characters are viable, so I found myself switching them to fit the situation.\n\nThe music is... [i]chef's kiss[/i]. \n\nThe only gripe I have about the game is the lack of social links, or rather the opportunities they offered to spend time with the characters. The Bond system is sort of the replacement here, with completing certain social activities gives points that are dropped into stat-enhancing modifiers, and the ability to unlock new modifiers by doing requests for different characters.\n\nI hope the release of this game and Persona 4 Golden on Steam are signs that Atlus will be bringing Persona 5 Royal to PC, but in the meantime this will do just fine. P5S stands on its own with a well-written story, gratifying gameplay and a reunion (or introduction) with this series' lovable thieves.\n",

I've played Personas 3-5, so hearing that Persona 5 Strikers was gonna be a Dynasty Warriors type game, a genre that I've never tried before, I was skeptical but still wanted to experience the story and see the Phantom Thieves again. Everything this game has shown off to me has put a big dumb smile on my face. The great combat system and bond point system, the returning music tracks along with new ones are always amazing, and the new characters that this game introduces are all great. If you're like me and have played Persona 5 but are on the ropes about trying this game, I highly recommend. Do be aware though, this game takes place after the events of the original Persona 5, not Royal. So don't expect there to be any references or any characters exclusive to Persona 5 Royal. I do also highly advise playing the original or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game in order to understand the Phantom Thieves more and so you're not completely confused on the story. Definitely a worthy GOTY candidate.\n\n10/10",

It feels like the same story of Persona 5 Royal, only with a different coat of paint. Some of the plot twists in the story (at least imo) can be seen coming a mile away if you pay attention. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal, I guarantee you'll love this game's story, but if you have, just be warned that it might feel repetitive.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion is hardest in the midgame, when enemies are becoming difficult and you have to strategize to capitalize on their weaknesses as well as dodge their strong attacks. Lategame just becomes a cycle of spamming effective skills to stunlock, AOA, repeat until dead, top off SP as needed with items. I did play on the normal difficulty however, so YMMV.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nA great game in the Persona series, though not without its problems and caveats, but if you're willing to overlook them, I guarantee you that you will enjoy this game, provided you enjoy Warriors-style gameplay loops.\n\nAlso, Sophie is best girl.",

I guess it doesn't matter, they got my money anyway. Won't happen again. As far as the game itself its even more diluted SMT mechanics than typical persona games mixed with a shallow musou action game. The gang goes on a scooby-doo esque tour of japan doing what they do. It was ok, but the crashes are beyond infuriating. If you want to play a good action game play devil may cry 5. If you want to play a good SMT game then just google that shit there's like a dozen of those. I doubt this is getting patched to an acceptable state any time soon.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, the font looks like shit. Fix your UI/Font resolution scaling.",

        "content": "Finished the game yesterday, would highly recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original game and its characters!\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised by how substantial the game turned out to be -- My save logged 38 hours, and I kinda rushed through the game because I was so invested in the story, so other people might have longer times if they went out of their way to do all the optional content as well.\n\nLoved all the interactions between the original cast, the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia were absolutely fantastic and played off the main group wonderfully, the soundtrack is phenomenal (as was to be expected, really), the story was fun and in true Persona fashion, the combat was fun and all in all I basically found myself unable to put the game down until I beat it, lol. Speaking of the combat, I really love the showtime and all-out attack mechanics! They're super extra and I love it whenever I get the chance to use one.\n\nThe plot of the game may have been a little predictable in some areas *because* it was in true Persona fashion, but it really did not feel detrimental to the game at all and it was still a very enjoyable experience regardless (and it also felt very nice to have a theory forming in your head to turn out to be true too)!\n\nAll in all, P5S really felt like a good and proper sequel game to me despite it not being in the classic Persona game format. Fun, flashy and memorable, this game is definitely going to be on my mind for a while.",

I cannot play it if I set it up to full screen it crashes everytime I open it I can only play it in windows mode.. I like the game but the windows mode is what makes my exoerience in this game nit that good. But the gameplay is good hope the next patch it will fix the crash in full screen mode then I will change my ratings with this one but for now it si not that good.",

Not recommended if you can't stand a lot of dialogue however, as some sections of the game consist of upwards of 90 minutes of straight dialogue, although these are all skippable if necessary. I would recommend waiting until a bug fix patch however, as I've run into a few crashes here and there, and the game is literally unplayable after about 20-25 hours in, due to a glitch in which after defeating a certain boss the game softlocks itself. Some have been able to get past it, but I personally have tried every fix those who have played past it recommend. Other than the obvious lack of love for the PC port, the game content wise is phenomenal.\n\nTLDR: Amazing game but wait for patch as you literally cannot progress the game at a certain point due to a bug",

I love this game to death and will sing it's highest praises to anyone who will listen. My only gripe with it though is that it isn't musou enough for me, and the ambush mechanic seems a tad overpowered in this. A couple of friends have told me that bumping up the difficulty alleviates that some, but I can personally manage. I just wish we could of gotten tons of shadows on screen at once like you do in some fights instead of those you quickly ambush, push one button, and then instantly win the fight.",

        "content": "This game is a must buy for people who have played the original or the Royal version of Persona 5 (or at least in cases have watched a playthrough). The story is as funny and emotional as ever and there are improvements on almost every level; The music is great, the characters still keep their development from the last game, the UI somehow tops the original, and the combat is very fun and addicting. I would suggest this game for everybody but the characters often refrence moments and characters from the original game and don't explain complex things over again like the metaverse or Morgana.\n\nThis section is to grade how worth it the digital deluxe edition is:\nThe digital deluxe edition is hard to say the quality off. In order to access the content you need to push the Play button specifically in Steam for the game and it will ask whether you want to play the game or the 'app'. The quality of the app is very sketchy as right from the start it has a Unity watermark at the beginning. It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.",

Everything we know and love from Persona 5 has been weaved into a glorious Muso-style dungeon explorer that does not disappoint.\n\nIt is pretty important to have played Persona 5's main game, or else you'll really be lost on a lot of the concepts that aren't explained for story development. This game assumes you have played the previous game already, and I admire that aspect. This truly feels like a continuation to exactly where things were left off after the main game. And I could not be happier.",

But after playing more and more of it i got used to everything and honestly it was a great experience. Once everything makes sense to you it can be a fun experience, the story, and characters are the same if not better than in P5. Although the combat may be different its really fun and unique and is a great hash and slash game. If you like persona games, this is a nice spin to the originals. And if you like hash in slashes its also amazing to learn and feel the unique aspects. 7/10. It could have been better but im happy with what it came too.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers was exactly what I wanted in an action Persona game. It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events. You can enter and exit dungeons all you want, and the day will still stay the same.",

There are unique and hilarious interactions between these characters that don't revolve around the protagonist. Did you think P5 lacked inter-party dynamics, this game has you covered. Their interactions are funny, wholesome, and personal.\n\nAction: This musou game doesn't feel very musou. The existence of Personas shatters a lot of the repetition that you might normally find in one of those games. Weaknesses matter, status ailments matter, and if you try and button mash you will get mashed. Dial this game up to hard and expect to be legitamely challenged. After the first boss my wrists were sore in a very satisfying way. \n\nMusic: Persona 5's tracks remixed/tuned up to meet the high speed combat. More instruments, more beats, more hype. Each time a new track came up I had to take a moment to pause and just listen. I'll be buying the soundtrack for sure.",

        "content": "If you're eye-ing this game then that means a few things: you either played Persona 5/Royal and want more of that, or if you're strictly PC, you're coming from Persona 4 Golden and are curious about this game. Overall Persona 5 Strikers is a unique take on the Persona franchise, and a summary of my thoughts on it could be summed up to *almost* more of the same if you're coming from Persona 5, or a somewhat familiar but also not-so familiar experience if you're coming from Persona 4 Golden, even though this installment in the series has wildly different gameplay from both Persona 5 *and* Persona 4 Golden. Details below.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else though, discussing the story must come first, as Persona 5 Strikers is set *after* the events of the main game of Persona 5 (NOT Royal, as I believe Strikers was released in Japan before Royal debuted anywhere). Following that, naturally the experience is enhanced if you have played Persona 5 from start to finish, and a few things about the mainline title are naturally spoiled. THAT SAID, Strikers actually does a very good job of being vague to the events of Persona 5 with the least amount of spoilers possible, so you can absolutely get away with playing this without playing Persona 5 first. Just be warned that a few things *are* spoiled, so it's definitely not spoiler free.\n\nMoving right along, the plot is written very well I thought; I went into this not actually expecting much, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised. Strikers' storytelling is identical to that of Persona 5 (surprising absolutely nobody), except this time all of your party members are right there from the get go. ATLUS introduces the new characters very nicely; I was fully expecting the new characters to feel a little awkward and forced, but they quickly found their place within the rest of the cast, and by the end they felt like they belonged and have been there all along. At some points, I felt as if Strikers had even stronger story points than Persona 5.\n\nThe gameplay I thought was unique; this game is a full on hack-n-slash beat-em-up type of game, which is very different from the main titles in this franchise. A word of warning that it never really changes its combat up too much throughout the entire game, so it becomes repetitive after a while. I frequently had to take breaks because of how repetitive it can get, and I found myself thinking that taking on additional requests that you get throughout the game to be kind of a chore since there's no real variety in the requests that you get. However, what *is* there is fun; the hack and slash combined with the tried and true persona summons works very well. There are a variety of combos to remember, and each character has their own set, along with their own elemental strengths and weaknesses previously seen in Persona 5. If you've played Persona 5, the old cast will feel pretty familiar as a result. It's worth trying every character out as soon as you're able to as well, since every character plays differently as far as their combos go. Pro tip: make sure you get comfortable with a myriad of party members too. It will not only expand your tool set when confronting powerful shadows, but there's a specific part where you'll have to basically use all of them at some point.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs very well on my GTX 1080; I didn't see a single frame drop, except for one spot in one of the dungeons which turned out to be a complete one off situation. This game is optimized well, but the only problem is that this game has a tendency to crash when loading into and out of the Metaverse. Please remember to save often, as crashing at some points could mean having to redo tough fights. I myself crashed twice at one specific section and had to play the same section three times total before I finally got through it. Those two crashes were the only crashes I had within my 45 hours of game time, however.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a great hack-n-slash game, and is a very good extension to Persona 5. While the gameplay can get repetitive, overall I had a lot of fun with this title and it really quenched the thirst of wanting more Persona 5 that I didn't even know I had. Highly recommended.",

While that may seem obvious I have lost hours of progress due to the games seemingly random crashes. I have played the game for 8 hours with no issue but advance in a single mission and the game can crash. It doesn't ruin the game but mainly its just an inconvenience at most.",

        "content": "35.3 hours in the game and just killed the second boss, i can tell from the start its a continuation of p5, at first i was disappointed about the fight style and really wanted the old fighting style but after experiencing, it i like it, when your in the jail (not sure if only me) but you get this feeling that it is unsmooth and also at leblance but suddenly it gets smooth then unsmooth and sometimes your game just crashes, very disappointed about the fact how you spend your character day as in p5 you have many options to wither you want to develop your relation ship with this person or enhance your character's knowledge or buy materials or do the palace and you have a dead line to complete, that what made me like persona 5 and got me addicted to it, its how will you spend your time? but it had been replaced with team bond in p5s.. didnt like the fact that your stuck in this day until you progress until this point, and you dont have a time limit its basically like yes complete this jail in 2 days in persona time! or 3 days, and the fact that you can leave the jail and rejoin with full health and stamina and your still at noon.. [spoiler] i really liked the idea how you unlock the lock for the treasure, the animation was mind blowing! how you spend your bond points is good too, the request is good but didnt really like the quest as if kill this persona with its weakness,[/spoiler] persona leveling up is a bit overpricing especially if you want to keep arsene til the game end, it basically supports changing personas for each boss,  i like the combo but in the same time my controller is going to die because of the spam, really loved the game play and the new mechanism.\n\n[b]spoilers until end of boss2; [/b]\n[spoiler] i really like how the story progressed, and how you can enter the jail using emma and there is this mysterious person behind it, the fact that you can return to the old jails and farm for exp and relooting the chest! how you can move freely while battling and switching between characters is amazing or even the fact that your teammates are healing you without ordering them too,and how you can stop the boss attack by breaking the ice that is in the floor or just shoot the knifes or using the party popper is amazing, i loved how you need to know your enemies past before confronting them, like how alice used to be bullied and you fight her past in order to unlock the treasure room, i also realized that they are facing something similar in order like the first boss in p5 had ann involved with her teacher so she gets in with alic and then in p5 the next victim was madarame whos pupil helped to defeat him \"inare\" so he wanted to help the writer guy, fun fact i hate the detective that is involved in the story as known as \"gramps\", the bond system is good bu as a replacement for the characters relation ship replacement no, [/spoiler]\n\nwill i recommend it for people who just wanted to try persona for the first time? yes and no, yes because the fighting style is good and not like a rip-off game and has good story too! no because you will get lost at first and there are amazing mechanism in persona 5 that hasnt been included in p5s, if you have a ps4 get p5 first then p5s or just watch p5 on yt to know how the phantom theifs started, but what about people who already played p5 and want to try p5s?  then yes i recommend it that is if you want to experience new game style and new features but with the same characters in p5\n\nin my point of view, dont buy it until they fix the crash and the suudden unsmooth game play but you can just buy it now if you dont mind the smoothness game play and the sudden game crash that forces you to leave the game without saving\n\nput in mind there is more positive points but i didnt mentioned it because i dont want to spoil the game more, but all i can say is the fighting style is my favorite!!",

(I kid you not it takes like 2 whole minutes of just loading after you launch it. Weird.)\n\nEDIT; \n\nThe current beta branch (which I am assuming the full patch will launch some time in the coming weeks) has fixed the crashing/hang ups for people. PLUS, if you're like me and were suffering from long loading times either on launch or just in general (even on an SSD) if you set the game to always run as Administrator it helps a lot, not sure why but hey it was worth mentioning if it helps anyone. :)",

        "content": "So... what is Persona 5 Strikers?\n\nShort answer it's Persona 5 the sequel with new flavors mixed in.\n\nBelow are my four key points to hopefully convince everyone who is curious, along with a few other bulletpoints.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are NO SOCIAL LINKS-now, most people would be upset by this, and yes, it is technically a loss for the series as a whole, but it's not quite as big of a deal as you'd might think. You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time. Ideally, this will also give Atlus the incentive they need to release all future (and perhaps previous) SMT titles on PC so I don't have to own a console for the sole purpose of their games.",

It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends",

Then also got the Royal version too and spent so much time on them that they are leagues better than this game. I think if your new get the original ones but if you have played them this maybe a okay DLC/Extension to the game\n\nHere is my overview: \n\nThe story is pretty much the same with weaker reasons\nThe fact that Joker feels like the weakest character \nEvery other character besides Joker feels really nice to play as my favorite is Ryuji \nThat you can't multi select or buy \nThe Persona system is more toned down\nCombat is cool at the start but very boring and repeat the same thing over and over again\nIt's like this - In a Dynasty Warriors game you fight large armies with your character but feel like a Badass. In this game when you start a fight you have to wait for a cut-scene. You're not a badass (Oddly since it's after the main game and you're basically a GOD KILLER) and the persona drops are a bit random.\nThe camera is odd when you do a spell/persona attack it doesn't reset the camera and there's no button for it to rest the camera. \nThe mini Map doesn't rotate - For me this is super annoying\nSeems like a lot of random stuff just to do the same fights over and over again \nOh and there's so many tutorial pop-ups I thought the original Persona 5\u2019s were bad but this is so much.\n",

        "content": "IMPORTANT!  THIS PREVENTS CRASHES! Make sure the aspect ratio matches your monitor, this will prevent the ONLY crashing I've ever had in this game. Set to Hard mode if you want any sense of challenge.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that this feels like a Persona game. Story, Character, Fantastic voice acting, it's all there. I've never been a Dynasty Warriors fan because all they ever do is rehash the same thing over and over again, and it rarely has any substance. They made a terrible Fate game series, an ok Zelda series, but they finally figured something out. (Of course, Atlus was there to watch over development like a nosy teacher looking over a child doing their homework. But this teacher knows how to teach properly.)\n\nThere hasn't been any problems with the game. You know, like real games when they were released when they were ready. No EA \"We'll fix it later\" shit. \n\nHow The Game Plays: This feels like a Persona game. Let me emphasize this. The battles still have a bit of strategy to them. You can't just run blindly in (at least on Hard difficulty) and wack hack away. And for people who don't want to play a game with battle substance, or the possibility of losing, you have Normal mode. If your 6 year old brother wants to play, you got easy mode. It's perfect. They got a difficulty for all types! And you don't have to start the game over if you find out Normal doesn't cut it 2 hours into the game like I did. \n\nPersona fans will enjoy this. Dynasty Warrior fans will enjoy it. People who hate reading, plot, and character development will despise it. But I suppose if you hate reading in the first place, you probably didn't read this far.\n\nEdit: Beat the game. This is THE BEST Dynasty Warriors game. Better than Dynasty Warriors, better then Zelda, etc. I only wish Makoto would call me back....",

However, in true SMT nature, hard mode has its difficulties, and easy mode makes grinding bareable.  It has all the feels of a post persona 3 game, just condensed, but never had I got the feel that the game felt rushed.  The dungeons are built so that they don't feel repetitive (unless you're looking to 100% the game, in which case of course you'll need to go out of your way to do some side quests).  For a spin off game I'd give this a solid 8/10 objectively, and 8.5/10 as a SMT fan.",

This game likes to crash... a lot.\n\nSo, I didn't follow this game's development at all prior to release. When I wrote what I did above, I genuinely thought I was hopping into a \"musou\" style game like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nYeah, no. This game is only musou insofar as that the combat system was done by Koei Tecmo. Little did I know, I was about to play a (really damn good) spin-off sequel to Persona 5. Of course, it's not as deep as the mainline series, but there's plenty of meat to this game and is full of Persona style goodness. The combat system is fun but far from perfect, but if they ever manage to really perfect it and reduce how annoying it can get sometimes, I would probably even prefer it to the turn-based system from P5 (and I really liked P5 combat). 100% a must have if you enjoyed P5 but probably not the best choice if you didn't. This game was clearly made for the fans since it's loaded with fan service. Even though I was totally wrong about this being anything like Dynasty Warriors, what I wrote at the top still stands.",

        "content": "I make this review very subjective as i played all 'Persona' titles and having a certain expectation.\n\nMainly I feel P5 Strikers lacks of Persona 5 original charm, and i was hoping with P5 Royal like expectation where Royal was extravagant but still delivers 'cool teenager' experience.\n\nI did played musou game like DW and SW, where it makes me as player feel very powerful, but it isn't when i play Strikes. Instead i feel frustrated as the enemies(especially the strong one) are very not balance until i reach 'not fun' point. Fair point i play the game in hard mode, but in Royal i played 'Merciless' difficulty in first playthrough, but it was still very doable and feel very fun. I know it's a different genre, but by holding 'Persona 5' title it should reach a same experience.\n\nP5 Strikes also feels very boring for me. It's repetitive and defeating enemies isn't satisfying. I think it's a problem in UX delivery, where in any original Persona's battle we potentially see something new like new enemy, new potential persona, new item, yada yada yada. Strikes has a contradiction design, while ambushing enemy is using same approach as Persona 5, but then every battle information is using musou game style, for example every item and new persona shown in the mid battle. How the **** i could see that in the mid of chaos, why not just using Persona 5 style T_T where everything we got is shown in the end of battle. This problem leads to I feel I don't get anything and not rewarded, heck i even often didn't know i have a new persona. Fusing a new persona is also not really that exciting, as i know i will be pummeled again by the enemy. It's unfortunate where Persona 5 main strength is UI/UX with their very awesome style.\n\nAnd lastly no Kasumi is a huge experience gap and it feels strange for me.",

        "content": "I want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers. They need to fix this and last I checked there were no Update patches yet. If they release one I will test and update the review once again.\n\nGame is fantastic though. Just be aware that you need a Outdated ancient technology to avoid crashes. Which is still unacceptable of a positive review. Get this on PS4 instead.\n\n\nMy Specs are\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600X\nMSI X470\nNvidia RTX 2060 Super\n32GB 3600MHZ DDR4 Ram\nWindows 10 Pro\n1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVME SSD\n1TB Samsung QVO 860 SATA SSD\nKingston 480GB SATA SSD\n2x 4TB 7200rpm HDDs in Raid 0\n\n(I have tested it on all storage drives and it only crashes consistently on the NVMe drive)",

The sim life is indeed less present, but the charms of the characters still shine the same. The combat is fine, but the game doesn't blow me away like the original (and certainly Royal) did, but it is certainly entertaining enough. Indeed, it's worthy of calling it a Persona 5 sequel rather than a spin-off as the story literally picks up where the original ended and it feels like a warm homecoming (literally) from digital friends you've been missing.\n\nIt is great that another studio manages to capture Persona 5's style so well, even though it is a lot less in-depth. For example, I liked the sim-life part of Persona 5 the most and the turn-based combat a bit less. Although I normally prefer action-based combat, I liked the combat better in the original as it feels a bit messy in Strikers. The attacks don't really feel they have a lot of impact and your super attacks (like in the original) deal the most damage. But they cost a lot of SP, but this may become a bit more balanced if you get a little further in the game and have collected more upgrades.\n\nDespite the sequel being 'not as good' as the original, it certainly doesn't make it bad. The charm of Persona 5 is just as strong and the combat is entertaining enough. Despite the fact that the sim-life aspect is less present, it is fortunately still somewhat there. But to see your friends with the same great voice actors just feels good and it is very entertaining to go on an adventure together again.\n\nI wanted to share my opinion about it, but I have to say it keeps getting better. Even though I've been playing for a couple of days, I'm taking it easy and I've finished only the first chapter by now and recently started on the second one. But I can certainly say this. For those who've played Persona 5 and are absolutely craving more, here's your sequel that's definitely worthy of it.",

The story is a bit better than vanilla Persona 5. In another way, I feel so good exploring famous cities in Japan and cannot wait moving to next area because I want to see more, it is a bit sad, there is not much exploration you can do in the city area except restocking some med supplies.",

But I can only recommend this game if your PC is capable to run it properly without issue, or if you have a PS4 and/or Nintendo Switch (which i imagine, the console versions run just as good)",

My only 2 big complaints with the game are that the bosses are damage sponges and the story can be pretty similar to the original at times. Overall though, I really enjoyed it and plan to continue with postgame contest and get 100%",

I have an RTX 3080 and it eats 100% GPU usage and is having framedrops in 4k60. Putting it on FULLSCREEN fixes this though.

If you want to fix the loading time without having to disable dlc, simply go to the local game files of the game, find the game launcher, right click on it and go into properties. Then you go to compatibility and check run program as administrator. It may not work the first time but after awhile of reloading I finally got good load times. However, crashes still plague the game. This is also a good fix for the infamous black screen after beating the fifth jail.\n\nEDIT: As of now, I beat the game and just went into New Game +, for some reason now crashes are practically non-existent and loading times being fixed all in all make the experience very enjoyable, as of now I highly recommend",

I was pretty confused when I bought Strikers thinking it is Persona 5.. but it's actually a sequel to Persona 5. \nFrom whatever few hours I played I can't really draw a proper conclusion whether I like the game or not, since I didn't want to play a sequel to a game I haven't even tried yet. So obviously I refunded my purchase. \n\n\n- Personally I vastly preferred Persona 4 style combat a LOT more. So that's about the only point I can make from the limited time I played the game. \n\nI'll make this review a negative one, because I feel like it's pretty stupid to release a sequel to a game that isn't on the platform plus the combat felt uninteresting as I stated previously, though I can't say if only playing for 2 hours gave me enough depth to make such a call, but I'm not about to find out before P5 is out. \n\n*I will re-do this review after they hopefully release Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal on Steam*",

It has a lot of what i wanted in the original Persona 5, the phantom thieves acting more like friends rather than teammates, because everyone is introduced immediately, the game has freedom for you to see them acting as friends, the writing is consistently witty and actually funny and not forced, and even while going through the \"palaces\" of the game (which they are called jails now), there is so much idle and situational dialogue it genuinely feels great to see everyone interacting with each other. \n\nThe combat is smooth and slick and keeps the absolute overwhelming sense of style as in the games prior, every character has their own gimmicks and unlockable techniques if you play as them for long enough, adding something new and it never once felt as if im forcing myself through battles, when you're strong, the game makes you feel like it and its just so cool.\n\nThe story and new characters we're also very interesting and the final parts of the game felt very reminiscent of the final palace of Persona 5 Royal, which is a nice touch, you also unlock the og Persona 5 and Persona 5 royal battle music after beating the game, as well as some extra things that add replay value to the game.\n\nThe only downside is, as I'm sure you've heard, the game is not a stranger to crashing, while my game has crashed only twice, i suggest saving very often when you are playing the game since when you crash, you have to go back to your latest save file,  hopefully these problems get fixed. \n\ntldr: its a very great experience and more of the Phantom thieves we know and love, with a DRIPPY soundtrack and combat, i say it's worth the price, i cans see the love that went into this game. It can crash but the only way to remedy that for now is to just save as often as you can. A very solid experience.\n",

It has everything you love in Persona 5 : the characters, the banter, the classic story of mean people you have to reason and understand the motivation of their crimes and also a cop helping/chasing you \u00e0 la Goro Akechi.\n\nNO ? \nWell you may enjoy the gameplay but not understand all of the concepts (even though they're re-explained) of a Persona game. I think you should either play Royal if you can (cause its way faster than original P5), or you should just watch a recap of P5 before playing, just to get a sense of how this world works. \n\nIm lovin it so far, it LOOKS AMAZING (animations, all the different attacks and QTEs you can do on the fly), the music is as usual SUBLIME, but I totally see how this could become a bit repetitive (but, I'll be honest, I love P5 and it was repetitive at some points), but the constant charm of characters, the great addition of Sophia, and the fact I can play Makoto in a cool as fuck action game. I mean. Top rating.",

        "content": "I am not a big fan of Musou games, and I am always skeptical of franchises I like having other studios come in and make a follow up to games I like, but man....So far, Atlus and Koei/Tecmo have done a amazing job continuing the Phantom Thieves story and this is already creating some great memories for me and giving me the feeling I got of pure euphoria when I played P5 originally a few years ago. \n\nFor now I recommend this game to anyone who was on the fence about getting this game that actually  played the original P5, because to me this game is such a beautiful and full progression that truly lives up to it's predecessors story and characterization of the phantom thieves. This feels like a nice second course and dessert to the original, that I am so glad we got.  I will post a more in depth review after completing the game",

Put it in window mode even with launch commands for window mode and it still will not go into window mode. I've really have to watch this game seven times before it goes into window mode!!! This game was not ready for PC it's a great game but if you're one of the many people out there that can't load into the main menu then good luck the fix out there is to put into window mode but this game refuses to do window mode I literally have to watch the game exit out and launch until it goes into window mode \n\nso the fix is something you need to do yourself and do to how game studios dont like talking about inner workings but it also explains so much it got to do with nvaida and amd hopefully this will help people out or point them to the fix\n\nstill will not recommend this game till a official fix and that means everything. \n",

        "content": "As of now, I have not finished the game yet, so I can't say anything for the story. I'll admit, however, I'm not expecting anything all too great. Most of the Persona series' spin-offs have been middling at best to outright boring at worst when it comes to any storytelling, so I'm not all too invested on that front.\n\nBut the rest of the game is pretty damn good insofar. The characters are all on-brand, thankfully not being the victims of flanderization. The new main cast members aren't annoying, which is more than I can say for most of the past Persona spin-off casts. \n\nThe actual game-play is much more in-depth than I was ever expecting it to be. Where in past warriors-esque titles you could mindlessly button-mash, you still do that. But in this case, it feels like you have to also employ a sense of strategy to how you approach the game. Then again, it may just be because I am playing on hard mode and your party could very well be dead in just a few hits if you aren't all too careful. If I had any complaints about the combat at all, I don't like how it makes the bosses HP sponges that you just gotta wade through. On hard, that shit is simultaneously highly rewarding whilst also being highly annoying. Rewarding in that you're constantly engaged in the combat and you have to be paying attention to every little detail; annoying in that if you slip up only just a couple of times, that's it. You're done.\n\nMusic and presentation carries over from the original game. I honestly believe it to be the standard to which any self-respecting JRPG should strive for, and that continues on into Strikers. \n\nAll-in-all, I recommend the title to any fans of the series. Or, although I don't recommend going about it this way, if you're not interested in the story and are just looking for a solid tactical action game, then I guess you could play it if you can stomach the anime bullshit along the way.\n\nNow bring Persona 5 to PC Atlus.",

BUT, there is some issues that is holding back the game of its full potential, this includes, game crashes and a bit of camera problem.\n[b] P.S:[/b] i added spoiler text, be warned.\n\n[b]- Crashes:[/b] i have gotten several crashes/freezes toward my playthrough in P5S, First crash is during [spoiler] Alice's [/spoiler] jail, during this Jail, i have gotten a crash that made 3 or 4 of my first hours worthless as i did not save and had to start at the beginning where i met Sophia. Second, is a freeze,after the gang defeated [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] and leave the Jail, it suddenly froze and i wasn't even sure if it was loading or not since there was no phantom thieves Logo.\n\n[b]-camera issues:[/b] for me, the camera was a bit annoying as it started to clip through objects like trees and walls, making it hard to see. easily can copy the camera movement from other hack and slash game (dynasty warriors or god of war 1,2 or 3) but did not and feels like the camera is fighting agaisnt me.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]  the game is amazing, The story, the returning characters, the new characters, the twist, the adventure. But there are way to many problems in this current build and is holding the game back. Wait till patches and updates come out for the game if you are thinking of purchasing this game.\n\n[b] edit:[/b] also, after the [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] boss fight, my game wouldn't load, i have restarted the game even my computer numerous times, i cannot continue onward after that, so the game is unplayable for me, please fix this issue ASAP.\n\n[b] edit 2: [/b] so, after Atlus/Sega fix the issues by giving it a more stable platform shape as a hotfix, i can finally continue the game. After finishing it, one thing is certain, it a rollercoaster of emotions and after they fix it, definitely recommend this game to Persona lovers, even thought its no longer a  J-RPG, they certainly put the effort to make the hack and slash aspect better. Now, i can finally say with certainty...i definitely Recommend this game.",

The game takes several aspects from the original Persona 5, in terms of plot points and themes. Characters like Haru Okumura gain lots more screentime than previously. The game will give you a good time guaranteed, regardless of the type of player. I highly recommend for persona fans or people who love action, RPGs or even just enjoy an anime aesthetic. There is something for everyone (if you are above the ESRB rating).",

Music is great and this game has a unique twist to your typical Musuo style game with certain RPG elements and doesn't do the usual liberate this area and kill 1000 enemies which caught me by surprise. Buyer beware at the moment because this game WILL CRASH! Also the game doesn't autosave, so if you forgot to save you, may have to redo a lot few grinding sessions if you don't save often or have forgotten to do so. I've gotten lucky so far and had to only redo about 10 minutes of battling and had to skip cutscenes and dialog I've already watched.

I can't recommend picking up the PC version right now. \n\nThe reason I say that is because of the random crashes that seem to occur during loading screens. I'm currently stuck in the beginning part of the first palace where you meet a certain character, and every time the part tries to load me out of the palace it crashes and I lose all my progress as there's no way to save from that moment on, I've done this section of the game 2-3 times already and I'm afraid it will continue on into later portions of the game,\n\n8/10 honestly would be a 10/10 if not for the crashing issues.",

        "content": "Do I recommend this game? Easy answer, yes! Complicated answer, wait a little bit.\nFirst, as much as Atlas says this is a standalone title, it really isn't. As far as I gotten into the game, there were many past references to the original Persona 5 game (unfortunate how it's only on ps4/ps5 for now\u2026) If you haven't already, play the first game. Ignore royal, waste of time haha. Besides that, I would consider it a direct sequel to Persona 5. Ever play Bayonetta (a very fun game as well, totally recommend)? It's very similar to Strikers, pretty much going into the \u201chack and slash category\u201d. I would suggest you use a controller too unless you have long flexible fingers. Keybinds for keyboard are kinda all over the place, so if you have the patience unlike me, Strikers supports change of keybinds (controller still recommended). Now, performance wise\u2026. Considering that it's a new game, there are lots of random crashes, and bugs here and there which ruins the entire persona experience, which is why I believe you should wait to buy this game till a patch gets pushed out. BUT! This game is great, takes elements from its different titles and mixes them. You will definitely know it's a Persona game, because of its catchy music and cool game art esthetics. 10/10.\n",

        "content": "I've put a lot of hours into both Warriors games and Shin Megami Tensei games - and I enjoyed the original Persona 5, so I was excited to play Strikers. Now, having beaten the game, I can say that Strikers is one of the stronger games in its genre.\n\nThe gameplay of Strikers makes it a very enjoyable game. The game mixes the beat-em-up gameplay of Warriors games and the adventure gameplay of Persona, with some sprinkling of what feels like an Ys game. You'll progress through dungeons fighting Shadow after Shadow as the Phantom Thieves, and is what you'll spend most of your time doing. Each member of the Phantom Thieves have distinct skills and fighting styles, with my favorites being Inari's ice/counter and Noir's Psi/Gun fighting styles. This hasn't been the first time Persona has taken a step out of the comfort zone, and this game does it well. Unfortunately, this gameplay change also does away with the day-to-day life-sim aspect that Persona's iconic for in favor of a more linear schedule - time won't progress until you do the objective. This in turn removes the Confidant system (in favor of Bond XP leveling system), so any character-fleshing-out is going to only happen during the story. This isn't a huge turn-off for me, but for how much this game feels like just an action-Persona title, it's a shame that sort of thing wasn't included.\n\nStrikers is also very strong aesthetically. It hasn't changed much from Persona 5, but that isn't a bad thing. Exploring the dungeons, while admittedly formulaic at times, remains enjoyable over the 30 hour journey due to not only the enjoyable combat, but also due to varying environments and soundtrack. New songs add to the ambiance of dungeon exploration, while remixes of old Persona 5 favorites pumping energy into the combat. Like its predecessor, Strikers is very strong stylistically.\n\nFor better or for the worse, the story is very much what you would expect from an SMT game - [spoiler]  teenagers fighting ever stronger enemies until they kill god [/spoiler]. Still, I think the strongest parts of an SMT story is represented in its characters. While the Phantom Thieves have their time to shine, much more of the spotlight is given to new characters Sophia and Zenkichi, so it's a good thing these characters are likable.  I found Sophia to be very adorable and good comic relief, with Zenkichi being even stronger comic relief. It's a shame they get more of a focus than the original team, but they're well written enough to be enjoyable elements of the story.\n\nThis game is not standalone; I do not think you can play Strikers without expecting to be spoiled with the plot of Persona 5. Various plot elements of the previous game are talked about in Strikers - such as plot and ending elements of Persona 5, or retroactively spoil the original game - why are characters in the original game not in this one? If you're already familiar with the plot of the original or Royal or don't care about being spoiled, you can jump right in, but otherwise I cannot recommend this as the starting point of Persona 5 newcomers.\n\nThe one major gripe I have with Strikers is the sole technical issue I've had with the game - the crashes. Roughly during every session I play the game - after about two to four hours - the game will crash, usually during a transition between dungeons and Japan or traveling to/from the Velvet room. I save rather aggressively, so I basically never lost any progress, but if you're worried about that sort of thing and rely on autosaves you should probably wait for a future patch.\n\nTLDR: Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5, featuring charming characters, engaging combat, and a great aesthetic. Any fan of both of Persona and Warriors based combat is sure to enjoy this game, but people who haven't yet experienced Persona 5 or wary of crashes should purchase in the future instead.",

Persona 5 is my favourite game of all time, and this sequel just makes me love the first even more.\n\nThe gameplay is a little hard to get used to, and sometimes there's a bit of level gaps, so do try to battle every enemy when possible. If I had to describe the gameplay, I would say it's something similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake, more than a traditional warriors game. It has dungeon crawling elements as opposed to just attacking a bunch of enemies on a map, and its honestly pretty good for a spin-off.\n\nOverall if you love Persona 5, this game is a must. Buy this game so that you can show ATLUS that there is a demand for Persona on PC.",

I myself used the nvidia control panel fixes (plus setting the exe to run as admin) and it has completely solved the load time and load crash issues I've suffered. (as far as I can tell atleast)\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, yes even those that have already played Persona 5. First off this game is fully based on the Persona 5 Original version of the world, not the Royal remake. If this bothers you please keep in mind that this game was released in Japan long before Royal was made. Keep in mind that this game also happens after the events of P5 so I fully recommend you play P5 first unless you came here specifically for the combat system over the story, at that point you'll be fine most of the major plot points revolve around current happenings anyways, I myself came for the story so...\n\nPoint on the combat system. If you already played P5 or P5 Royal you might have issue with the combat system as it takes the, beat the life out of waves of enemies with everything you got, approach over the turn-based quality over quantity enemies that the mainline games have. The fusion system is slightly simplified as is the persona strengthening system. You are slightly screwed out of you're previous sources of items, armor, and weapons, but in turn you have and adorable new character who will handle most of your material needs. You also have Joker's awakened cooking abilities and a 100% fixed flow of time, also UNLIMITED TRANSIT between the real world and the metaverse, due to the shorter in-game time you are given to clear the palace. DAYS WILL ONLY PASS ALONGSIDE STORY PROGRESSION. No getting bad ends because you spent to long getting pestered by Mona to sleep. There is also a million other little things you'll learn as you play that differ from the mainline games but you'll learn them fairly easily.\n\nI dearly love the Persona games alongside it's older edgier cousin. And so far the game has been amazing for a spin-off of a spin-off series. You do have to look at it like persona Q in that it is fairly different from the game or games that it spawned from. Igor is once again eating popcorn far away from the side disaster probably drinking tea with his boss. So just, realize that like a lot of games, you won't know how much you'll enjoy a game till you play it or see the systems in action.",

        "content": "While this game is a great sequel to the Persona 5 storyline, the gameplay is wildly different that some players may be put off at first if they were just expecting another Persona 5.\n\nReally need to have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to understand the background of a lot of the characters and appreciate the connection a lot of them experience in the game. The story itself is pretty stand-alone, but the interactions that some of the characters experience or reference aren't.\n\nCombat itself, while intensely different from the mainline game, is quite enjoyable both from the standard attacks, various ways the different characters you can control function, the way weaknesses are handled, all the way to the All-Out Attacks not just being a 1-hit KO necessarily. All of the systems provide depth to the combat, but don't complicate it too much to allow the player to still fully master it in the course of normal gameplay.\n\nStory, Voice Acting, Music, all are Top Notch just like the mainline Persona 5 game. All are accentuated by no Confidant system being in this game like in Persona 5. While that might be a detriment in some aspects of truly getting to know some characters and having more 1-on-1 interactions between characters, it can also help keep the story going at a smooth pace with how the 'dungeons' are laid out.\n\nBoth a pro and a con at the same time in different aspects, is the fact that there is no time/day management in this game like in the Persona mainline games. This means that there's not as much planning needed for those that were hoping for that aspect. However, it also means that players can go back and truly explore and 100% the 'dungeons' and such without worry that they will miss something because they mismanaged their in-game time/dates.",

        "content": "EDIT: Ok, I've tentatively changed my review for now because I've played a lot since I first made it and haven't experienced any more crashes. I'll leave my original review below for two reasons. First, according to other reviews, the crashes are still a major issue for some people, so I might have just gotten lucky, and people should be aware of it. Second, I think it pretty accurately expresses what I love about the game.\n\nIf they fix the crashes, this is an amazing game. If they fix the crashes, I can give this a positive review. If they fix the crashes, I can talk about how this game brings back the same feeling I had playing Persona 5. If they fix the crashes, I would recommend this to both Musou and Persona fans alike. If they fix the crashes, I can say that this actually feels like it would even appeal to people who weren't ever fans of either. Please fix the crashes, This game obviously had a lot of effort and love poured into it, especially for something that I was expecting to be a quick cash-grab. There's no reason it should have the negative reviews that it does. It truly is amazing if only it lacked the technical issues. I've only put ten hours into the game so far, and I've already had it crash twice so catastrophically that I had to restart my computer.",

        "content": "I liked the combat system in this game, the transitions into combat is much faster and enjoyable than the classic turn base mechanic in the original Persona 5. Don't get me wrong I do like that system. This game is more easy to understand and defeat enemy opponents as you get to know their weakness from the start with the third-eye ability and Futaba analysing the enemy mid & start of combat. Which makes sense since this game is based right after the original Persona 5 game. So Joker would know all enemies weakness and what persona mask he should use to strike their weakeness.\n\nWhen you have the correct characters while in the jail you can then use them to strike the enemy weakness and do massive amounts of damage, they do have environmentals attacks in sum jails that can alleviate the problem of accidentally initiating combat with characters that do not have the correct abilities to strike the enemy weakness. On the other hand, you can just max out Joker's slots with persona masks from fusion or the compendium in the velvet room, and hope he has the right mask with the right ability to strike the enemy weakness during that combat situation but that's inefficient as it would just deplete Jokers stamina making him useless, unless you pump him with items that can recover his SP.\n\nHowever, a solution they can introduce is that I would loved for them to bring back the ability to switch out characters during combat by idk a bond upgrade since they removed the social aspects from the game.\n\nAnother thing I kinda dislike is the inventory system, I hate having to pause the combat to then scroll down a ton of purchased items to find the correct item to use to for example recover SP to a character that's out of stamina. \n\nA solution they could add to fix this would be a redesign in which they categories the inventory to have HP items in one section, SP items in another and lastly the curables ailments items in different sections for quick and easy location and applying the item on said character that needs it.\n\nI will not mention story as I would like to not spoil it for any persona fan that hasn't played it but overall it a good hack and slash game and story in my opinion does seem kinda rushed but it's great.\n\nFor price, I would loved to have paid \u00a310 less but I'm still happy with my purchase. As the game is fun and enjoyable. As well as I did it so that ATLUS & SEGA can bring Persona 5 Royal onto steam once they see that the Persona series makes them bank (I will not of course pay for it if the price of the game is ridiculous and instead wait for it to be on sale) on PC, and they finally release a port.",

I WAS PISSED. You would think for a $70 game I I bought deluxe) they would give you a perfect gaming experience but nope. In total it crashed on me about 6-8 times. It was very annoying that you had to do it again. It was horrible and painful. I honestly think we all deserve better than this if we are paying a premium price for a game. \n\nFor the game itself, I personally don't like Dynasty Warrior type of game play but Persona 5 strikers make it fun by adding many elements like fulfilling side quests and meaningful story. I was a bit irritated now I have to go to Playstation 5 for Persona 5 but not playing that beforehand did not affect my understanding to the story. Overall it was a great game, yet there is serious stability issue and I think players should get compensated for going through the hassle of force exit during game play. It wasn't released on early access for goodness sake.",

I'm usually not a fan of Musou game, but this one actually includes a lot of the Persona 5 identity from the main game, and it's always a pleasure to meet the Phantom Thieves one more time !\nHowever, I can't recommend the game right now because of one single (big) issue : the random crashes. In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.",

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^",

From what I hear, Persona 5 Strikers has 30-50 hours of playtime, nearly half the playtime of Persona 5, sitting at 70-100 hours. Since the playtime is shorter than a regular Persona title, it\u2019s somewhat expensive. I think that 40 USD(?) would be an acceptable price. It took me 24 hours to install this game, but it was worth it! I am having a blast playing it!\n\nThe dubbing is high quality despite the English voice actors having to work at home. The music is top-notch - the new opening is fantastic, the battle themes are incredible, and the city themes are catchy.\n\nBattle:\nAwesome gameplay. When you pull your gun out or summon your persona, time stops so the player can think. Showtimes and all-out-attacks are flashy and stylish. Atlus decided to remove the turn-based RPG style and replace it with a hack-and-slash style game. I have 0 problems with this change, and I think it is fun!\nNo more SP? Well, head to a checkpoint and leave the Metaverse! Time doesn't pass when you leave a Jail in this game.\n\nInstead of the confidant system from Persona 5, the BOND system exists. This new system gives buffs to health, SP, persona stats, shop deals, and a ton more. \nWho could forget the fun persona fusion feature? It's still here! Instead of talking to demons to get their mask, masks randomly drop after killing demons.\n\nExtra:\nNot only does this come with the game, but it also comes with a digital artbook, the entire OST with new tracks, and a 67-minute behind-the-scenes movie. These little aspects make me happy.\n\nMost importantly, Ryuji says the F word. In my opinion, it is a 9.5/10 game. I recommend buying it.",

The game play is differnt from the turned based Persona 5 Royal but still enjoyable you play as all the previous Phantom Thieves minus Crow and Violet but theres two new playable characters definitely buy this game if your a fan of the series and want more time with the Phantom Thieves",

Played the royal edition the whole summer on my PS4 and coming to play this makes me remember why this series is amazing. This game isn't the same as the other Persona games,but it's still a persona game. Badass OST, stylish finishing moves and other Persona 5 stuff, almost all of it is here. Having to meet Phantom Thieves again was fun[spoiler] Not meeting Akechi though was a bummer [/spoiler]. And there is a lot of fan service [spoiler] The dialogue when Joker acted as a decoy in the first jail was pretty funny ngl(when Ryuji said is this a deja vu and other dialogue that came before it) [/spoiler] I haven't completed the game yet(only finished the first dungeon) but i would give it a 8/10. Totally would recommend!",

        "content": "I don't believe in unbiased reviews, but I do believe in going into a game unbiased before playing. I can't say I did that with Persona 5 Strikers because I was so dang excited to play this game.\n\nUpon finishing, I'm happy. Some people say this is a good template for future games, but they're wrong. This is a definitive and refined version of a Persona 5 sequel, but it lacks the emotional depth and sense of time that makes the mainline games so compelling and amazing.\n\nBut what Strikes does well is get the gang who you've already enjoyed a 70-110 hour game with, and take you on another adventure with them. This is a game for those of you who maxed the Confidants in Persona 5, spent a year in Tokyo stealing hearts, and decided you want just a little bit more.\n\nI enjoyed the road trip aspect, as it feels like a more grown up theme than a growing up theme - one of my rites of passage into adulthood was travelling with friends, and Strikers captures that perfectly. This is a game that has grown up with people who played Persona 5 a few years back.\n\nWith that in mind, the writing is solid. Sometimes the characters feel like archetypes, but that's par for the course of a Persona sequel. I see it as more akin to the characters being more comfortable in their own skins, openly being parodies of themselves in a lighthearted fashion. It's also not as on the nose as, say, Persona Q was in this regard, so that's a good thing. I went along with it, at least.\n\nMy biggest reservation was that Omega Force were developing it. I hate Musou games, and I won't lie, when this was first announced I felt a pit in my stomach - I asked myself if this would this be a Persona game I skipped. Thankfully, it's more RPG than Musou to its benefit. I still prefer the turn-based combat, and I miss the Confidants/S.Links, but the action RPG combat complements the more streamlined Persona experience in general, giving the game a sense of pace that isn't needed in a mainline release. I'm amazed that they pulled it off, but they did.\n\nAbout the only flaws, for me at least, with Strikers are the bugs. When it works, the game runs like a dream, but there are some visual glitches in All Out Attacks that are jarring, and the amount of times the game crashed or froze was, frankly, unacceptable. I'm hoping Atlus/Omega Force go in and fix these issues, but I can't help but feel it's tainted my experience. My best advice to deal with them is save often and hope the game doesn't crash during a long story segment.\n\nBugs aside, this is a solid game. It's not a groundbreaking title, but it is a solidly made game that sets out to do a thing and does it. If you've played Persona 5 and wanted one more adventure with the Phantom Thieves, this is \u00a355 well spent.",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[b]Persona 5 Strikers[/b] on the surface may seem like another musou-game spinoff. While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Strikers is a beautiful blend of the JRPG and Musuo genres, taking the tight action and combo oriented gameplay of a Musuo and laying it over top a traditional dungeon crawling Persona title. The story is well written, and feels like a true successor to the ORIGINAL Persona 5.\n\n With no references to Royal, due to the different teams in different studios working on these games side by side, it leaves itself open to, potentially, DLC. I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

This direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 plays similar to the Warriors type games but there are differences that make it feel much more Persona than I had originally expected.

Where I had originally expected a similar style of combat to Dynasty Warriors, I was pleasantly surprised at the tactical depth of this game; button mashing isn't going to get you very far. I would probably say it's more similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.\n\nAfter 40 hours, I can say I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's very well stylised and I am happy to be playing it on PC. That being said, I - and as far as I've seen, many others as well - have been experiencing crashes. Make sure to save at every chance you have and you shouldn't ever lose much progress. This still screams for a patch, though.\n\nBesides this, my only annoyance is that the menus are relatively slow to navigate. Again, they're very stylish, but having an animation between every sub-menu makes it a bit tedious sometimes. Could just be me, though.\n\nIn short, extremely fun game, plagued by the occasional crash. If you like both Persona and Warrior games, which I do, this is a no-brainer.",

Combat's fun, story is really good, and every single voice actor for this game put their all into their performances (especially Max Mittleman, Ryuji's voice actor, who steals the show in many parts of the game.) Truly recommend if you've played Persona 5. Play with a controller if you have one, as it just feels so much better than M+K.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few negative reviews about this game complaining about performance issues. Now either I am just REALLY lucky or some of these people have no idea what they are talking about. Silky smooth performance (locked at 60 fps granted), not a single crash my entire play through, and the only \"bug\" I encountered was some odd phrasing on an item description.\n\nAlso also, all of you folks who's reviews consist only of \"bring P5 to steam\"..... just be patient and stop whining about it ALL the time. I know a lot of people REALLY want to play this game on PC, but when you are so insistent on endlessly complaining about it, you just look really pathetic.\n\nAlso x3, this games soundtrack absolutely SLAPS.",

This game further develops the characters from P5 and brings new ones to the table, which are all pretty well written.\nSo far, the story is pretty decent, nothing stellar, though it's hard for me to judge, not having finished the game yet.\n\nGameplay is a solid mix between Persona 5 elements (Elemental weaknesses, baton pass, all out attacks, and of course personas) and what you'd find in the warriors series of games (basically inane amount of enemies and unique character combos). Some people seem to think this game is a musou. I'd argue that while it borrows a lot from the genre, it is, in fact, mostly just an Action RPG, which is not a bad thing in the end. However, due to the nature of the game, this can easily feel repetitive after a while.\nDifficulty is a bit confusing though. Normal encounters often ends in seconds while bosses can be extremely frustrating at times.\n\nGraphically the game is decent, UIs are stylish as you'd expect from a Persona game, but... the anti-aliasing they use (FXAA) is terrible, and affects the UI, this is pretty bad. I really recommend to disable the game's AA and make use of [url=https://reshade.me/]reshade[/url]'s SMAA instead or, if your PC can handle it, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405510545]supersampling[/url] to make things look good.\n\nThe soundtrack is full of bangers, as you'd also expect from a Persona game. Some of the tracks here are the best Persona 5 and its spin-offs can offer. Play this with good headphones.\n\nNow... Not all is good. Be warned that the game is locked at 60/30 FPS and sometimes randomly crashes when loading cutscenes. Save often.\n\nIf you can handle its little flaws and quirks, then this game is a pretty solid entry in the Persona franchise. And a pretty good game overall.\n\n[h2]If you don't have the time, here's the tl;dr...[/h2]\n* Game is a sequel to Persona 5 and will be much more enjoyable if you played it before.\n* Game is not a musou. It's an Action RPG where encouters are made of massive amount of enemies. The battle system itself is a mix of mechanics you'd find in Persona and Musou games.\n\n+ Story is pretty good and the new characters are great.\n+ Battles are pretty fun.\n+ The soundtrack might contain some of the best tracks in the series.\n\n- The difficulty curve is pretty weird. Normal encounters are easy, bosses are frustrating.\n- Graphically \"decent\". The Anti-Aliasing is terrible.\n- Framerate lock. (60/30 FPS)\n- Game sometimes crashes.\n\n[h3]Obligatory \"Please bring Persona 5 Royal to PC pls\".[/h3]",

        "content": "I purchased this game for both PlayStation and Steam, why? Well, for one I want to encourage Atlus to release more Persona games on Steam and for two: I absolutely love Persona 5 and want to encourage P Team to make more games! \n\nAlthough, let's discuss this game, eh? It is based six months after the events of Persona 5 (Original, not Royal). I went into this game with low expectations, I thought it was going to be like Hyrule Warriors (which I did not like) or Age of Calamity (which I did like, kind of) it is not really like them at all. I was expecting some chaotic combat with no real logic and a lot of frustration but... I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe writing is fantastic, although being a Sojiro fan-girl I am entirely disappointed that he merely appears for the briefest of times and then is only mentioned in passing... and as our moral compass old guy replacement we get Not Sojiro. We poke our Phantom Thief noses into Not Sojiro's life a little too much and he winds up following us like a bewildered puppy. Now, don't get me wrong, I love when new characters are added but a little food for thought once you've played this game... \n\nThink about the entire the plot of this game - take Not Sojiro out of it and put Sojiro in his place and have some slight tweaking of the narrative (i.e. Sojiro's Government Job past coming back to haunt him) and all the dramatic stuff that happens with Not Sojiro instead happening with ya boy... that would be infinitely more meaningful than slotting in this random new guy who I didn't find myself attaching with as much as I think the game wanted me to. For instance there's one point - maybe half way through the game where something dramatic happens (trying to avoid spoilers) and the first thing I'd suspect Futaba to do in this situation is call Sojiro for help, and does she? No. I believe they're trying to imply she wants to be independent and not frighten him or something, but ... give us some credit here, she's a teenager. She'd call Sojiro.\n\nThere are a lot of other new characters that come in to play too, and they're all well written, even Not Sojiro, there I said it. All the characters and their dialogue, feels genuine. This isn't like a \"straight to video\" release with shoddy writing and no heart. You can tell a lot of love, passion and energy went into the writing and the localisation team did brilliant! I really enjoyed learning more about each of the Phantom Thieves and seeing sides of them relating to social issues we are all experiencing in the world now. Props to P5S' writing team, they did a good job of making the villains sympathetic and relatable.\n\nThe game does not have time management dilemmas like you'd find in P5 or P5R - you're more along for the ride with this one. There are a ton of side quests to do, making personas for the compendium is slick and much more intuitive than in P5 (I think so anyway), and whilst there is a bit of grind at points, the combat and game play overall is fantastically enjoyable, so many different ways to pummel enemies into dust. \n\nIt's fast paced, I enjoyed the fan service, I laughed out loud at a lot of the dialogue (as I said the writers did a stand out job!). My only gripe was Not Sojiro. But hey, I'm not a writer for P Team so what do I know!?\n\nSeriously though Persona is one of my all time favourite game series - 5 being my favourite (controversial, I know!) and I hope Atlus will release the older ones on Steam at some point and future releases too. I would recommend this game even if you're not good at fighting games (I'm not but I love this one!). The difficulty is fair and there are some bosses where you'll be unbelievably punished for one slip up but there are plenty of opportunities for revives and healing items to be used and learning to switch between all the characters took some time for me but once I got the hang of it I adored the combat.",

        "content": "Writing after finishing my first playthrough.\n\nThe most important thing before going into the game is that you know that [b]THIS IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO VANILLA PERSONA 5. THERE IS NO KASUMI YOSHIZAWA, THERE IS NO TAKUTO MARUKI, AND THERE IS NO THIRD SEMESTER.[/b] \n\nI like to get the negatives out of the way first, so:\n-The audio mixing is a bit off. Not game ruining by any means, but sometimes the voices sound off or the music is a bit too loud.\n-As per usual for any rpg, the game takes a little while to really get going. Not a huge flaw for me personally, but I know some people may get impatient.\n-The only recurring characters despite the main cast are Sojiro and Sae, however they still get bare minimum screen time. Don't go into this expecting full fledged confidants like in a normal Persona game.\n-And lastly... The crashing. Oh god, the crashing... On a first play through my game crashed 8 times and caused me to have to fight the final two bosses 3 times each because the game didn't give me an option to save after completing the fights.\n\nNow the positives:\n-The soundtrack is just as phenomenal as ever. Throwing more rock and metal into the signature P5 jazz style and it works so damn well.\n-I personally found the writing to be pretty entertaining, of course it's filled with some of the same anime tropes and cliches, but I love it all the same.\n-The new characters are very endearing and really end up making the story. I've never really liked the OC characters to spin off games in any franchise, but Sophia and Zenkichi are especially well-developed and I'm glad that they're in the game.\n-Personal preference, but I do enjoy the warriors style hack and slash games. Mix those with some of the fine intricacies of Persona combat, and I ended up loving the gameplay a significant amount more than I thought I would.\n-And... if absolutely nothing else, I was more than happy to fork out the extra money for the deluxe edition to pick up a franchise I love and hope to prove that there is a market for it on this platform. \n\nIf you have any interest in this game, I highly suggest picking it up. You definitely get your money's worth and won't be left wanting. Try to play through the original P5 first, but if you don't care about story or character and just want to pick up a fun game, I can vouch for that as well.",

        "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "i just finished the first \"chapter\" of the game, and i have to say it's absolutely amazing. the gameplay is fun as hell, and quite in depth for a musou style game. every character has a unique gimmick to their movesets, and even joker himself has a TON of variety because of the different personas. you can end a basic combo with Triangle/Y on the controller, and depending on how many attacks you did prior, the finisher will be different, and some of them even use the equipped persona for a skill, while not using SP. this is shown the most with joker, for sure. next is the soundtrack. it's amazing. persona/SMT music has always been amazing, and this is no different. the story is great so far as well. it's just more persona 5, which i'm very much a fan of.\n\nthis game has very few cons, in my opinion at least. i've read some of the negative reviews saying the game is buggy, and borderline unplayable, and frankly that's just false. there's always going to be edge cases, but i've had almost no problems. the game has crashed twice in the about 10 hours i've played, and both times were in loading screens, not random crashes, in the middle of fights, like i've seen some reviews say. i also haven't had any major performance issues either, but i will say the game definitely runs better in exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless windowed.\n\nTL;DR\nthe game is amazing and i highly recommend it, but it does seem to crash every now and then, usually in loading screens, in my experience. the experience is overall better if you've played persona 5 first, since this is a direct sequel, but so you can definitely understand what's going on if you haven't since they provide enough context to make things make sense. but seriously, play persona 5 if you can, preferably royal, since it's way better than base P5.",

        "content": "A great extension of the phantom thieves story. They feel much more like a group of friends in this game, everyone feels like they've grown from the past game's events, and all the villains are much more interesting in this game. \nThe game-play is fast and fun, a great mix of the muso and smt based combat. The game did crash on me once so be sure too save often. \nBeat my first play-through on hard, it's not that difficult just make sure you exploit weaknesses and cook sp meals.\n\nPut persona 1 and 2 on steam thx atlus.",

        "content": "Strikers serves as a good sequel to Persona 5. It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.",

        "content": "Summary: Gameplay is fun, a true sequel to Persona 5, but crashes, and a lack of good PC mainstay features makes it a bad purchase.\n\nHardware: \nR7 1700X \n16GB RAM\nGTX 1070\n2560x1080 75hz Monitor\n\nI have had roughly TEN crashes. The number of times this game crashes is absolutely insane.\nNot to mention, the default controls for the game are terrible with Keyboard and Mouse, making it damn near unplayable without a controller. And the keybind settings are mediocre at best.\n\nGraphical settings wise, the game lacks ultrawide support, which is a huge point against it for me personally. The game ALSO does not apparently support refresh rates above 60Hz (as modders have discovered it is apparently tied to game speed), meaning that I can't take full advantage of my 75Hz monitor. Most games also feature a way to pause when tabbed out, or to keep the game running, which P5S lacks, making some situations annoying (I.E. game pauses when I respond to a friend on discord, etc). Other than that, the game looks beautiful and I haven't had any minor or large graphical glitches yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'm able to clear up to an hours worth of content, and then the game crashes, making me replay it. Since the game is actually pretty tough on higher difficulties, and grinding isn't really a viable option, this is extremely frustrating. Until these issues are fixed, I CANNOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME. If you would like to support the Devs, purchase the game on another platform. Do NOT reward shitty ports. The game IS fun when it works, and I'd recommend it, but the state of the PC port is rather poor and I cannot personally recommend it from my experience.\n\nAlso, Atlus, please give us SMT V on PC.",

        "content": "I love the Persona Series.\n\nI love that Atlus is taking PC more seriously.\n\nI hope that SMT + Persona and anything else by Atlus, Sega, and Sony come to PC.\n\nBut this game has performance issues on PC. It crashed on me many times, and I thought that I was having issues with my Bluetooth since I was playing on my Xbox One controller via BT. Nope. All my other games work fine playing many hours with my controller. This particular game just keeps crashing during some battles.\n\nThe game itself is pretty decent, but not amazing. I honestly take solace in that fact since it's not supposed to be a \"flagship\" persona game. So don't expect it to be your GOTY or anything. \n\nNot recommending it due to the performance issues, but definitely a buy for Persona fans.\n\n\nEdit: I wanna expand on the actual gameplay + story. \n\nThe story is mostly similar to regular P5 with a few 'villains' that need to have a change of heart. As the story progresses, you and the gang find a new one in the same fashion as the games prequel and some of your teammates may play a role in each as it might relate to them in some way. So, don't expect any change to the typical formula. (Atlus, if you're reading this, try something new)\n\nThe gameplay is a hack n'slash taking inspiration from some musou games. However, instead of hordes of them attacking you at a time, you ambush guards that spawn a group of enemies for you to fight. You can switch between your party to play as whoever you want and each of them have their own move sets. There are also special abilities that you can use to down enemies that are weak to them(similar to P5). The level designs are ok, but they're kind of a chore to run around in. I do like the dire shadow boss fights, though. The one main boss fight I was in was pretty decent, but nothing that really grabbed me into the fight through some sort of mechanic that would have kept me on my toes.\n\nWhat could have made it more fun is if they took note from the Batman Arkham games and allowed more freedom of movement. Joker is shown as being gymnastic and a bit of a freerunner. Imo, they should have taken aspect and expanded on it a bit. It doesn't necessarily have to be 1:1, but something more aligned with the cutscenes they show would be welcomed. It's not an open world game, I know, but maybe create some interesting ways to get to the objective?\n\nOverall: 8/10",

        "content": "I was a bit worried at first that this game wouldn't live up to Persona 5, and well, I shouldn't have been. This game is fun. It's a lot of fun. The combat is so much fun, it's fun to go looking for it instead of avoiding the JRPG vanilla Persona 5 which gets tiring after 100 battles of grinding. It also doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, you can ride a skateboard and run over shadows with it. You get to do realtime combat with all-out attacks, follow-ups, one-mores, technicals, persona skills/swapping, baton-passes, etc etc. It's a blast to play. I HIGHLY implore you play the game on Hard for your first run. This game NAILS hard mode so well. Unlike other games that make their higher difficulties bullshit and unfair, this game makes it fair. Not only are the enemies tougher, but so are you. You do more damage as well. Combined with dodging and countering, it makes for a super fun combat experience.\n\nThe story is pretty damn good so far too. It feels like a proper sequel to Persona 5, though any part of the game like the base game does feel a bit more empty / simplified. Keep in mind that this game is a sequel to the vanilla Persona 5, NOT ROYAL. All the characters are the same as ever and enjoyable to watch and interact with. While Confidants/Social-Links are not present, you still get to bond with your friends a good amount not only in combat but in the real-world through events; reminiscent of Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest complaint you'll probably hear from this game are the bugs. The game has this weird tendency to crash whenever you leave/enter the Metaverse. I'm unsure why. You can luckily save a lot in this game, especially right before you load a new area so it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance as long as you save. The game also has a 60fps cap and some poor Anti-Aliasing which I hope will be fixed with a patch. It's not enough to make the experience any less enjoyable, I just hope it's fixed soon because it may be more buggy depending on the hardware.\n\nOverall, very fun game. Definitely worth the price. It's around 50 hours I've seen from other playthroughs. Not too far off from the length of Persona 4. There's a good amount of fan-service here. I highly would not recommend this game if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal yet, as you probably won't have as much of an emotional connection with the characters / plot as you would with. The DLCs aren't very worth it in my opinion, unless you get them from the Deluxe version. The All-Out Attack Pack seems to be relatively worthless, while the Legacy BGM Pack is a bit pricey and only worth it if you're a big Persona fan. (Or just like Mass Destruction)",

        "content": "Persona, and Shin Megami Tensei by extension, have a pretty sizeable barrier to entry when it comes to engaging players. Turn based RPGs have their fans, but there are many people who find their gameplay loops to be unengaging. Persona 5 Strikers does an amicable job of bridging the gap, bringing classic persona tropes and mechanics to a more action oriented gameplay style. \n\nThis is no Musso/Warriors game, at least not in the same style of Hyrule Warriors or One Piece Pirate Warriors. If anything this plays more like a faster paced Kingdom Hearts game, for better and for worse. This game oozes with style, and its gameplay mechanics are just deep enough to be interesting while not going too deep into combo centric button strings. \n\nThat said, it's far from perfect. First and most glaring are the crashing issues. This game needs you to save often, and a mistimed crash can erase a good bit of effort since saving while dungeon crawling is limited to checkpoints. A saving system like this is fine, but when your game will crash without warning- it makes the checkpoint system feel less like a stopgap and more like a slight to a player who lost 40 minutes of exploring because they didn't save. \n\nBeyond that, it's a direct sequel to Persona 5, which is not available on the PC. This doesn't make the game unenjoyable to new fans, but it does throw you right back into the action assuming you know most everything about the Phantom Thieves and their six months at Shujin Academy. Despite the gameplay being a perfect way to introduce someone not usually into RPGs into Persona- the story is perhaps the exact opposite. Although for those who played 5, or at least read some wiki pages to get some backstories, the story is a fun romp across Japan with some touching moments. \n\nAll in all, Strikers is a good game. I hesitate to call it great for I believe a lot of my personal enjoyment comes from getting to see these characters again and a drive to 100% the game. Be wary of glitches and crashes- they will ruin some of the fun and you need to be prepared for that. But if you want some fun action combat drenched in Persona 5's signature style with some more of the Phantom Thieves: it's certainly going to scratch that itch for you. Whether that itch is worth scratching is up for you to decide.",

        "content": "[h1] this is a direct sequel to P5. newcomers will be lost [/h1]\n\nnon gameplay stuff:\n\nthis is like persona 5 2. it's another one of persona 5. all of the RPG elements are basically completely gone but the story and structure is the same (if not better and improved!), sometimes i can forget it's even a different game. i'd even say the plot seems stronger here than in persona 5 (dont get me wrong, P5 is one of my favorite games ever). it does start a little bit slow but not nearly as slow as P5.\n\nthe \"real life\" activities seem to have been greatly reduced, exploration of the city is marginal. however animated cutscenes and story moments have been really increased. what follows is a far more linear game where you get to have more contact with the story and the plot. the scale of strikers is smaller in terms of systems but it's also more focused.\nso although i sometimes miss having extra optional activities i'd say it was a worthy trade off for having a more linear story focused game. that being said: if you are looking for a lifesim this is not it.\n\ngameplay stuff\n\n[b] playing on hard mode is essential [/b] although it may take a little getting used to. it might feel clunky and overly punishing until you reach the first proper bosses. but when you do whooo boy. it's great. i seriously wasn't expecting the game to be this much fun. i went in expecting the gameplay to be something i would have to grind past and overlook so i could get to the \"good bits\" and boy was i wrong. the gameplay is one of P5 strikers strongest aspects.\n\ni typically don't like dynasty warrior type games but this right here is pretty darn good. standard enemy fights are really fun when their numbers are really large and there are lots of interactable objects, however, that's rarely the case. around half the time you will fight small groups, which is a little bit repetetive. that i have to admit. however the other 50% of the time it is a blast. especially in those amazing boss fights like i said. ([b]reminder to play on hard mode![/b])\n\noh, and frequent use of baton pass increases enjoyment by a lot! however don't expect to like every party members playstyle right away! a lot of important moves are locked away and they all take some getting used to. in many cases i disliked playing as one but then i unlocked a new move and it all clicked. (pro tip: there are really great playstyle tips for all the characters in the tutorial menu, as well as the base combo moves listings)\n\nspeaking of which when playing on hard you will have to change your party composition constanty, which is definitely a hassle i do admit. basically since you can change party in between fights it's important to cycle out those who are low on health and SP. this also helps keep the XP distribution even.\n\ni will probably update this review when i have played more. i can't really put an arbitrary number on it but i can say that fans of persona 5 will definitively like this one. even if you don't like the gameplay (but i have a feeling you eventually will!) the story is enough to carry the experience.\n\ni was worried that although i  would like the game i wouldn't like it enough to feel i got 60 dollars worth. i can now confidently say that my fears were unfounded. thus far the game is going above my expectations and it seems to be a worthy 60 dollar title.",

        "content": "[h1] Building up on its predecessor... [/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers (P5S) is best enjoyed if you played Persona 5 (P5) as it is best described as an amplified P5. The character quirks are more prevalent, the humour is more prevalent, many of the reused songs of P5 got more intense, and whether intentional or not the dialogue got A LOT more fellow-kiddy which only adds to the hilarity of it all.\n\nMuch of the music originates from P5 but they are complimented by just as many new songs for the new shop, activities, fights and metaverse locations so this is as solid as you would expect it with an added increased variety in music genres.\n\nFinally, while mementos do not exist anymore, the game has its own grinding mechanic affiliated with new requests awarding much more interesting rewards than the simple XP and money of memento requests of P5.\n\n\n[h1] ...yet also losing some of its original charm [/h1]\n\nThe social gameplay feels like a P5 lite with some systems absent, most notably the time management of activities, the levelling of social stats and the school in-class questions and exams. The absence of those systems also leads to a poorer diversity in world activities with shopping being the only real activity left. Even then, the majority of shopping is done in an all-in-one online shop with magic instant delivery (the game fails to provide a legitimate explanation for this although it tries to). It is a bit disheartening, but the new shop UI and song make up for it to some degree.\n\nCooking becomes a much more important part of the game, becoming more diverse and more invested with you being encouraged to scour all shops to find new recipes and ingredients and now contributes to the bond system replacing the P5 confidants.\n\nThe bond system allows for a certain level of customisation of your experience as instead of linear confidant progression, you can invest your skill points however you want, specialising in certain areas in the order that you want. \nThe bond progression is also more gameplay inclined, progressing as you play like a glorified XP bar, and while friends will give you missions to somewhat enrich their personality, those will have a much stronger \u201cRPG side quest\u201d flair to them rather than the personality or story focus of P5\u2019s confidant system.\nHowever, the gang evolves as a complete group more often and with significantly more voice acting than P5, you get to see a lot more chemistry between the different members than you did in the previous game.\n\n\n[h1] Combat, a successful conversion that stays true to its origins [/h1]\n\nMaking up for the less diverse real world, the metaverse has gotten an upgrade with a more vertical level design and Joker having gotten a lot more agile. Many more objects can be jumped on and off from but can also be interacted with in unique ways which will tie directly into combat.\n\nAnd combat is the biggest change of this game, switching from turn based to a hack and slash which is, overall, a success. Everything you learnt from P5 is still here: personas, all out attacks, knock downs, elemental affinities and weaknesses, gun special attacks and the new animations, combat sounds and of course the UI are all satisfying and switching between powers, combos and characters is as smooth as can be.\n\nThe system can feel overwhelming at first to someone new to Persona as you are being given access to the full cast of P5 right from the start which is a lot of combos and a lot of persona powers to learn.\nOnce you figure it out non-boss enemies will very quickly fall into the \"one shot combo\" area which can make the game feel a bit repetitive and/or grindy; something P5 already suffered from but P5S is at least a lot faster to switch in and out of combat.\n\nHowever, while you will be facing several dozens of enemies at once quite early on leading to a lot of visual mess (albeit good looking mess), the game remains fairly forgiving and will let you get through a few levels with simple X and RT smashing while you figure out your combos.\n\nAfterwards, the game will nevertheless throw significantly more mini-bosses your way than P5 did which makes for more interesting combat; although the danger of those mini-bosses is damaged by the leniency of the game. Indeed, saving spots have become much more abundant than they were in P5 and without the time management component, the game encourages the player to jump in and out of the metaverse to get a complete free recharge of HP and SP before teleporting back to the save spot with no downsides whatsoever, making the game devoid of resource management if one makes use of this mechanic. \n\nMaster Arts are a new system in P5S which are awarded for directly playing a character. After playing a character for a sufficient amount of time additional combos are unlocked and that amount of time is arguably too little. However, it is an interesting mechanic to reward players for sticking to a character with some additional toys.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Transforming turn-based boss mechanics into hack and slash mechanics is no easy task and P5S does not really succeed at it...or maybe it chose not to and that's a good thing.\nBosses go through different moves and phases and the ideal strategy is often to learn their sequence of action, wait for the sequence to end, exploit their weakness, and blow your combos during their break between two sequences and repeat. This is in essence a turn-based system, except you get to press the dodge button to avoid damage during the boss' \"turn\".\nIt's however not a bad system, bosses in P5 were very enjoyable and they are just as enjoyable if not more in P5S. While they get away from the hack and slash fast paced power fantasy and fall more into a the calmer strategically turn-based realm of things, this change of pace in combat approach is most welcome and still manages to capitalise on some of the new aspects of the combat.\n\n\n[h1] A great sequel yet a questionable first release [/h1]\n\nOverall P5S is a great game for people who wanted straightforward easy fun with more of the P5 characters' personalities and interactions with some extra new gameplay ideas which all work well. \nHowever, with the removal of much of what made P5 such a unique and interesting adventure, P5S fails to exceed its predecessor, although it also does not feel like it is trying to and is content with being, in essence, a high-quality expansion.\nWhile newcomers to Persona or Persona 5 might be able to enjoy P5S as a standalone, the game is unquestionably a better experience by having played the original Persona 5 which makes the release of this game on steam before a potential Persona 5 Royal port questionable at best.\n",

It ditches most of the time-based mechanics in exchange for more combat mechanics, and I think it works.\n\nUsing a combination of fairly well-designed movement, combat, Persona interactions, and story, P5S is the game for anyone who likes Persona 5, and with realtime combat opens the game up to more people.",

CONSTANT, CRASHING. It's unbearable, I have 10 hours so far and the game has crashed 4 times. Koei Tecmo needs to get off their ass and fix this, after all this will be one of their biggest games in a while. If you have the choice between PC and another console, go console, it's much better optimized as it's already been out for a year. Im on my 3rd attempt of the Alice jail treasure securing becasue it crashed so damn much. I'm losing my patience. I wish I got this on switch instead. JUST FIX THE CRASHES AND ILL BE HAPPY",

        "content": "Once again great to see the Phantom Thieves in action especially on PC. If you plan to play this game and haven't played Persona 5 (Vanilla or Royal), this may give away some spoilers from them and you may lose context on certain things. \n\nGame is real fun. Combat is typical of Musou/Warriors games with the Persona style twist. The new characters are amazing. A several scenes alone (if you had played P5 prior) remind you why you loved Persona in the first place. \n\nOn the technical side of things. In the beginning of the game there are a few issues with audio. Mainly on the English dub end. Characters sound lower in several sections of dialogue. For example Yusuke, sounds lower than the rest of the group in the first few scenes of the game. I think that's due to the situation the English cast and crew were placed in mixing audio because of COVID\n\nSecond, some stuttering issues at 60fps on 3D cutscenes at times. I'm on windowed mode. Haven't checked at full screen and/or 30fps.\n\nThirdly, I have experienced I believe one or two crashes already. This was on windowed mode too. Luckily I wasn't too far from certain checkpoints so I didn't lose alot of progress. I recommend anyone else to continually save. \n\nGive the game a try...if you played or watched Persona 5 Vanilla and/or Royal.",

The fighting got a new dynamic to it, and is entertaining throughout the whole game. \n\nNow the negatives:\n-The gameplay is a bit tedious. (Like you can't check side missions in palaces, so you have to get out. You can't shop from anywhere else, but from the base even though you do shopping on your phone. And you can just leave and rejoin jails to regenerate without any penalties)\n-The jails (dungeons) are just a tad bit repetatives in it's objectives.\n\nThat's it. Not the perfect game, but worth it non the less. I reccomend you to play the base game quickly (with it's 150 hours of gameplay :D) before buying this game, so the story fascinates you even more.",

I didn't experience any framedrops during battle, which is the most important part to me!\n\nGraphical Setting: Everything on high, resolution scale = 1.5\nPC specs: Intel i7 6700k (not OC), NVIDIA RTX 2060 (not super), 32GB RAM, game runs on a SSD.\n\nLoading times are almost non-existent and I haven't experienced any glitches so far.\n\nGameplay:\nThat's the other point I can imagine most of you are wondering. Especially since it isn't a turn-based RPG anymore.\n\nI was not sure if I would be able to enjoy P5 Strikers. Especially since I am used to turn-based battles in general.\nFFXV really gave me a hard time trying to find some love for the game, without success.\n\nSo, here we are at P5S. I started it with the horrible experience I just explained in mind. Watching out that I would still be able to get a refund if it doesn't suit me....And what can I say? Without realizing I already player for 18 hours! :) \nI hope this encourages anyone with a similar experience to mine to give P5S a serious try. I am pretty sure you won't be disappointed!\n\nEdit: After some more playing I can call this game \"Japanese food guide 2021\" for sure. Every time I play this I get hungry AF.",

The new combat system is fun and challenging, the music is godlike as always, containing a few of my new favorite tracks from the whole series, and the whole game is as stylish as ever. The Digital Deluxe Content is also the most effort I\u00b4ve ever seen being put into a digital Artbook/Soundtrack.

You can either have the camera turn too fast or too slow. no inbetween.\n- Also the mouse camera movement feels broken at times\n- Mouse curser keeps appearing whenever there's a cutscene or a text box\n- Doesn't seem to fully utilize an SSD. Some loading take longer than they should.\n\nI repeat it's a good game. But it isn't worth 60$. If you wanna play it i recommend getting it for 40$ from a keysite or something. I'll change my review to a positive if the game actually fixed the issues above.",

        "content": "For someone that's never played a Persona game in my life, this one is pretty decent. The RPG hack 'n slash feels much better than the turn based gameplay that the others have, which is the only reason I bought and played this. However after 20 hours of gameplay I feel like the fun is over, the story is good to an extent, go and rescue people from being brainwashed, yada yada. But that's the extent of the story and gameplay. \n\nI also feel like the everything revolves around the gameplay rather than story. Up to the third dungeon you are doing the same thing you have been doing for the previous two, maybe it's just me but going and getting [x] but you have to do [y] before being able to do [x] three times over seems monotonous and boring. There's nothing unique that changes in the dungeons that makes those aspects better, it's just the same gameplay loop and I personally got bored of doing the same thing to go onto the same thing again, but in a different area with different enemies. \n\nAs I stated previously with the game feeling like it revolves around doing the same thing to progress the story. It would've been better for me if to progress the story you wouldn't have to do the same thing you did in the last dungeon, but it was a bit different. Instead of go to three bird cages, fight mini boss, which then allows you to fight the actual boss, there could've been other ways to lead up to the final boss fight, such as puzzles, or do some task that isn't in the metaverse that unlocks a path to [x] that helps you get to the boss. \n\nThe gameplay however is good, being able to create persona's, you have bonds/ skill tree, different characters you can play as e.t.c, it's very fun. I enjoyed playing as much as I did, but after doing the same thing for the third time, it just felt repetitive and less engaging because you already knew what you had to do,  you already knew what was going to happen. But hey, maybe that's the whole point. I just didn't enjoy that aspect.\n\n---\n\nAfter being told that the game actually gets good after the third dungeon I decided that I would give the game one last shot and well finish it, I can say for sure that I was not disappointed. Albeit what I said previously and parts of that review still holding up, the game is spectacular. Gameplay does get better after the third dungeon and it is a great story driven game, apart from spending most of it with dialogue, cut-scenes, etc. But that might just be the point of a story game. \n\nSome things I wanted to address though is the frequent random crashes and the inconsistency between cut scenes.\n\nFirstly crashes, this game has crashed *a lot* for me and when I say a lot, I mean hoping for the best the game doesn't crash when you're on the last boss fight, all items used up, 2 team mates down and hoping it doesn't just seize up and tell you \"no\". I say this because it has happened to me at the end of boss fights where you finish a boss off, goes to a white screen, then the game crashes, very infuriating and needs fixing. \n\nSecondly, the cut scenes and dialogue are just inconsistent. I don't know why it's necessary for 3 types of ways to display something happening, you have the first way of just showing it via the just dialogue bars and the characters talking, you either have to progress by clicking or having it automatically do it, then there's it being rendered in the engine and an actual cut scene AND THEN there's it being an actual animation. What. The. F*&k. There are some parts in the game where it will progress in the order and it just doesn't make sense, just show me it in one way! \n\nBut those are just some nit-picks. Great game though and introduction to the series, at least for me.",

        "content": "First of all. [h1] Hoooooo boy [/h1] Props to Omega-Force/Koei Tecmo, and P-Studio for making this game happened, and to Atlus for publishing this game to steam (praise be to Atlus). I will gladly buy any MegaTen related games.\n\nOkay so, I'll make this as concise as possible.\nThe story (although a direct continuation from the base game) is basically a reimagine of Persona 5's with a bunch of changes specifically for this spin-off. I'm just gonna say it follows the same structure, that's it (for those who have played, you'll know what I mean). It actually reminds me of the movie called HER because of how the plot heavily uses artificial intelligence as its main topic. Expect a lot of dialogue since this is still a persona game.\n\nThe gameplay is good no doubt about that, actually great. Who knew that a game that uses the combination between musou combat with persona mechanics would actually work wonders, I never thought it would be this good. Each character you control has different combat style and special ability. It's really the highlight of this spin-off.\n\nProbably the complains I have are the price and possibly, the end game content (I have my doubts on this one though) since when you finish the game, the only replayability value that this game will give you after finishing it are new game+ (you can totally 100% achievement in the 2nd playthrough) and a new difficulty. I really hope Atlus will update this game with new content, although it's unlikely to happen because this game was released in Japan a year ago and (to my knowledge) there had been no update since then.\n\nAll in all it's a good game, as expected of Atlus. Even though they really milk this series hard, you can bet the spin offs of each game are done and polished really friggin well. A definite must have for those who enjoy both persona and musou combat type of games.",

        "content": "Why are you reading this review? It's Showtime!\n\nBefore getting into the actual review, you should understand that this is a direct sequel to Persona 5 which is a Playstation exlusive title. \nIf you didnt play the original game or at read the manga or watched the horrible anime adaptation, you propably wont enjoy this game if you give any hsit about story. The game treats use as if you already know what happend, which is nice for people who actually do, but not for you if you have no clue whats going on. \nAlso, I think you will find it hard to care about the characters if youre not familiar with them already, since we spent over 100 hours getting to know them and their quriks, so a scene of them hanging out and having fun is propably pretty boring for somone who doesnt know them. Unless you are somone who just mashes the \"skip button\" as soon as text appears on the screen, go and play Persona 5 Royal first(improved version of P5)\n\nNow for the actual review:\nThis game is an absolute Banger. It really embodies the spirit of a sequel. The story is new and intresting while your previous knowledge is still helpful. The Dynasty Warrior gameplay combined with the Persona 5s unique style could have turned around really messy but they NAILED it! I have a lot of respect for creating a fun action RPG that still feels like Persona. You will still find yourself scrolling through your Persona skills to exploit your enemies weakness, All-out attacking and batton passing but now you can dash around and do cool combos and use your surroundings to your advantage. I think it goes wothout saying that all of this looks amazing, as expected for Persona 5. \nThere is a good mixture of new music that bangs just as hard as the first soundtrack and old tracks (remixed or not) that make the game sound familiar. \n\nThe game only crashed only once on me in 14 hours of gameplay, which really isnt a big deal. I cant imagine this game letting me down, thats why Im confident to write this review already, unless it isnt edited or deleted after I finished it, I stand by every word that I said :)\n\nGo out and steal some hearts!",

Combat, although hectic at times, is never a chore and the story doesn't feel forced at all, everything flows perfectly! BUT if you are looking to play this game without prior experience in the Persona 5 universe i think it might become a bit confusing and little too much to handle, at the opening hours especially.

        "content": "It's definitely not going to be the most enjoyment you get out of a persona game, but it's a decent game overall. However, their are a few issues on PC that just are saddening. The Default controls are AWFUL. they're really bad, so I recommend using a controller, or changing them. I decided to play with a keyboard just to get the default experience. Their is a lack of multiple aspects from the original persona 5 that I wish were here, but this is a spin off game after all. The game plays well enough, their is a few minor odd things that happen (that may happen on console as well) but it isn't anything game breaking. The one thing that really makes me upset is when I alt tab, and go back into the game the dodge button (alt) will start making windows noises if you press it over and over again. (and you'll basically be using dodge alot). I hope to see more persona ports on steam! These games are great, and I'd love nothing more than to play them here, even if their are issues. I just hope some of this stuff gets patched out, or fixed in some way shape or form, and I want to look forward to some nice ports in the future!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game. If you're into that, then you'll like this game. THOUGH, nothing on this page will tell you that. BUT as soon as I saw the Koie Tecmo logo followed by Omega Force, I got a sneaking suspicion this was a Dynasty Warriors game. THOUGH, as someone who's only played a handful of these and 3 of their off shoots (including this one), I kind of like this one the best. Yeah, you can button mash, but this and Hyrule Warriors was better at forcing other actions. I've played Persona 5 for a few seconds, but got SUPER bored with how story heavy it is, and how awful the story is, this has a bit too much for me. It's a neat and faithful melding of Persona and the DW formula. Visually this is the best Dynasty Warriors has ever looked. Clear that Sega/Atlus seem to be very protective of this property and were very hands on with it. \n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona then this will definitely scratch that itch. I'll stick around for the battles, and just blow through the story, even though I know from previous attempts of getting into this series (P4 Golden) it means I'll probably get a bad ending, oh well. I'll look up an FAQ if the alternative endings are better or if it prolongs the GAME play. I like it. 3.5 out of 5 for me.",

Also has missing plot points from P5 Royal AND a fairly major character that was introduced in Royal.\n\nI really tried my best to like this game but I just couldn't push myself to get past the flaws, kudos to Atlus though on publishing more Persona games on PC, I hope they will continue to do that in future/",

        "content": "24 Hours into the game and I feel confident I have gathered enough information to provide a fair review.   Gameplay wise this feels like a love child between Persona 5, and Kingdom Hearts.    Many people try to compare it to a warrior game, but its battle type is much more like Kingdom Hearts,  yes there is tons of enemies but the RPG elements and interactions push it more toward the KH battle system.     Over all if I ignored the crashes  this is one of my favorite games.    However due to how often it crashes  even on a high end machine like mine.  I cannot possibly recommend this game to anyone.     There is 2 major crash types I have encountered,  First is the blackscreen.    This one happens when first booting up the game and in order to force it to close you have to open a new instance of windows and close it from there.    It usually only happens every other load.      Second crash happens during the course of gameplay and happens during loading screens which there is ALOT of.    There generally is alot in persona games but there felt like there was more in this one then previous.      Every 2-4 hours of gameplay you can expect to crash while transitioning between zones.     So if you do buy this game always save before you move from one zone to another in order to save frustration.        \n\nThat said,  the gameplay is over all pretty excellent the new way they handle bonding is interesting I liked using them as skill points.    And the persona point system is pretty grand too.   But the game is poorly optimized.\n\n\nEdit:   Just made it past Kyoto boss and it seems after the load screen it goes to infinite black screen as others have reported.     This product seems to be faulty cannot even finish the game.",

I played Persona 4 shortly after it released on PS2, Persona 4 Golden when it ported to PC and of course P5 and P5 royal on PS4. They\u2019re all amazing games that all fall within the same idea of combat, time management and Social links, but for some reason atlus decided to make this one a hack and slash. The combat feels mashy and brainless compared to what I would expect from a Persona/SMT game. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that it\u2019s a great game within its genre but the style of combat turned my immeasurable hype into disappointment. It just doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nEdit: \nI want to point out that when I wrote this review I had 1.5 hrs and the game had crashed once, regarding it as an anomaly. I thought perhaps I was being rash and gave the game some more time. I stand by all I previously said. Additionally the game crashed a further 3 times forcing me to replay the same scenes over and over.",

There are less personas in general in the compendium to collect but still has like 60+ so not that bad.\n\nNot sure how long this game will be, at my current time it feels like I still have a long ways to go and won't be reaching the end anytime soon so expect somewhat of a long game going in which is all the much better if you ask me",

        "content": "*IMPORTANT* \nThis game crashes ALOT, at the worst time possible. I'm not sure why; to make things worse, the checkpoints to save the game are quite far in between so uhh, the anxiety of hoping the game won't crash while you're far away from a save point is stressful. So if you're playing, remember to save as many times as possible. Redoing what you did from the past 3 hours is not fun. \n\nAnyways, Persona 5 Strikers is a nice sequel for fans of Persona 5 (Royal). However, the combat is a musou-type game, being completely different from Persona 5's turn based combat. Although, it is very interesting to see how they incorporated hack and slash with the tactical use of personas & baton passes.\n\nThe overworld exploration is satisfying, being able to walk around Shibuya, Sapporo, Osaka, and so on with your pals is a nice feeling. \n\nOne thing to note is how the new Velvet Room functions. With the removal of social links, you can't get bonus exp for your personas from social links. Instead you can level up your personas through the use of PPs (Persona Points) which is a little disappointing but it's fine.\n\nTo further explain on the removal of social links, Persona 5 Strikers introduces a mechanic called Bonds to replace it. With bonds, you may unlock certain bonus perks like \"Extra Money Dropped Per Battle\" & so on. You can get bond points from playing through the game.\n\nIt's a game to play if you're interested to see what's up with the Phantom Friends after the first game. Not so for the depth of the combat/gameplay, Persona 5 (Royal) still triumphs on that part. \n\nSome mechanics from the first game were revamped or changed to be better/worse. It's up to you to make your own opinion on it.",

If you are a fan of Persona 5 and just wanted more of the characters and a good continuation of the story i think you'll find a game that you love right here!",

        "content": "i really like this game it is kind of a like a continuation from persona 5. i have seen some people say you can play this game even if you did not play persona 5, but in personal opinion i would recommend against that as you most likely will not understand majority of the things they bring up about what has happened in the past aka Persona 5.  I was really happy to see this game out as i am a huge persona fan and have played person 4 golden and persona 5 royal and i was really sad to have beat the game and of the ending being a sorrow goodbye. This game is a lot like persona 5 but with the formatting of Fire emblem warriors or what others have said dynasty warriors. You can use your persona in this game but there is more hand combat rather then only using your persona or automated bullets like in persona 4 and 5. i love that you can also be the other characters and walk around aka yuskue and ana and etc, that is one of my favorite things as i am a huge fan of yusuke and i love being able to explore the jails as him and use him more!  I do really enjoy this game and got it the day it released but i will say there is a ton of glitches going on as the game tends to crash in times where you are unable to save and have to restart again. That can be a real pain in the butt especially when your grinding or in the middle of a movie scene. But i overall really enjoy this game and would recommend it to any persona fan and CAN NOT WAIT FOR PERSONA 6 TO COME OUT! SOLID 9/10.",

        "content": "As a hack and slash enthusiast, I knew I had to buy this game. I had no previous experience with any Persona or Shin Megami Tensei media, but I believe this might change. Anyhow, the combat system is surprisingly very satisfying. Sure, it does not have the complexity of DMC5 or the absolute fluidity and smoothness of the original Bayonetta. However, it does not take away from the core hack and slash experience, in fact, the combo system reminds me a bit of how combos are handled in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance as you can, in theory, keep comboing endlessly, granted you don't get staggered, which, to me, is somewhat satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a 9/10 game for me.",

I would say that this is a great spinoff of the original P5 and it is really a great game for fans.\n\nAfter the boss fight the game crashes suddenly without saving, and there are really a lot of crashes.\nI hope whoever has brought the port to PC will really fix the problem.\n\nThe game itself resembles the structure of P5 (not p5r) and while it is Persona enough, I wouldn't really consider it a game that is worth the full price tag. Also, while the combat is a great combination of real-time combat and the traditional P5 skills, I do think think that it is somewhat too flashy. \nIf you have played P5 before, you can easily tell the similarity and the parallel structure, and I would say that P5S is really an attempt to use the same structure to tell a somewhat different story. It has the core of the later part of P5R and the narrative structure of original P5.\n\nGreat music, great artwork, great Japanese VA. There are no complaints about the game itself beside the crashes. It is a solid game when on sale, and the price tag is not fully justified with its current length.\n\nOverall, I would give it s 8/10. Solid for P5 fans, but not so worth the full price otherwise.",

        "content": "16 hours in so far\n\nDid not enjoy the combat at first (I'm not a fan of Dynasty Warriors) but it soon grew on me since it does still feel like a Persona game but I would not consider this a sequel like many say it is and more of a spin-off. It does not contain any turn based combat which is a staple of the Persona series nor does it have social link (I assume it's because it takes place after P5, maybe it also assumes all links are maxed?). It's a sequel in terms of the story only. \n\nI would recommend this game if you're a big Persona 5 fan (like I am) otherwise I'd probably pass on it unless you're really into Dynasty Warrior type games. A lot of the references in game won't be understood by someone who has never played Persona 5. Also Persona 5 royal characters are not in this game so maybe that game isn't considered canon? \n\nIn terms of technical issues I haven't had any gamebreaking ones so far. I did have my game crash once during a loading scene after a big fight 5 hours into the game. I haven't experienced another crash since then. Just remember to save often because there is no auto-save so you could potentially lose hours of gameplay if it does crash on you. \n\nOne annoyance I have with the game is it forces you to exit the dungeons at the checkpoints to refill your hp/sp. It literally makes no sense to add that annoyance since it just adds on another 10s to watch the loading screen. The dungeons this time around are a lot more linear compared to the P5 and that may turn some ppl off. It was alright for me. \n\nI haven't finished the game yet and I'm still guessing who the antagonists are but so far I'd give the game a solid 7.5/10.\n\nedit: 40 hours and I finally finished the game, the story at the end becomes very predictable and pretty disappointing but the main issue I had with the game was still the random crashes which happened me right after the last boss fight which was a bit of a slog as you can imagine. It was a terrible feeling to have to redo the entire fight again even though I thought the design wasn't bad compared to other jrpg final bosses. It pulls the common jrpg trope I hate the most where it splits the party but this time around I felt it wasn't super imbalanced unless you basically never play your non-main party members. I can't recommend this game until they patch the crashing issues which they have refused to even acknowledge on their official forums.",

Feels slightly different compared to other Persona games (ex. no social links), but overall is an amazing sequel to Persona 5. Highly recommend playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game as multiple references are made to the original. However, keep in mind the P5R endings are non-canon (as far as I'm aware) and therefore no P5R-exclusive characters like Kasumi or Maruki are in this game.",

Especially since none of the conversation seems interesting. Like listening to teenagers talk disappointing since i played the first as a child. If you like where ff15 went you may like this same principle, i personally started out on ff1 for nintendo and hated 15 as most everything that made it feel like a rpg was gone for me. This feels the same. Its actually one of the few final fantasy i never did/wanted to finish. I get the feeling this will be the same unless it picks up.  I hate that rpgs are trying to turn into hack and slash. If i wanted a hack and slash which i occasionally do ill go play a dynasty warrior which doesnt eat up most of your time with talking.

The review is mostly semantic - Persona stans have already bought it, and if you aren't part of the crew yet this might be a weird place to jump in. For what it's worth, the game is respectful of spoilers to the previous game, and was made before Royal so you're safe there, but you probably want to wait for P5R to get ported to PC before diving in. \n\nAnd Atlus, I'm ready to throw money at a Sophia figure whenever you're ready to make one.

The story is a typical Persona story, fullu wholesome with some twists that you see coming a mile away, but awesome nonetheless.\n\nIf you liked the original Persona 5, or Royal even though this game never mentions anything from that, then this is a wonderful continuation of the story and I cannot recommend it enough.\n",

While the Dynasty Warriors gameplay may be generic or old to some, to me, its something I played when i was really young so its something very special to me no matter how generic it may be. \nThe characters here feel the same as what they did in Persona 5 though a little more mature but still making them more unique from one another like Yusuke and Ryuji.

It's not necessarily difficult as it is backtracky, boring and obnoxious. They give you 8-15 requests at a time, you can only have 8.

The story is a direct continuation of P5, and so if you haven't played the first one, you'll definitely be lost in this game. The writing quality is on par with if not better than the original. \n-Characters: There are some points where the original Phantom Thieves feel exaggerated, but for the most part they're very strong. Not nearly as flanderized as previous Persona spin offs. The new cast members are excellent additions. It's impressive that even with 10-ish characters, no one feels left out of the story. Also Haru got her screen time.\n-Gameplay: The combat is simple enough to get into, but has enough elements to make fights feel like more than just button mashing. Weaknesses, One Mores, Environment attacks, etc. all help keep you thinking about how to attack.\n\nAside from a few nitpicks here and there, I would say this game is excellent. Very fun combat and a great sequel story. The main limiting factor is if you haven't played P5. If you haven't played it, I wouldn't recommend this game. The combat is fun, but it's not enough to sell the game if you're not also interested in the story. Play P5 first so you'll understand these characters and what they're talking about when they mention past events.\n",

The story for this game is alright but the new character additions are pretty good. Overall, this is a good game, hopefully they update this game on steam to make it better optimized over time. I've had a few friends tell me they had no issues but I wasn't able to get passed the first cut-scene in the game when I played. I will still say that this game was definitely meant to be played on the Switch.",

        "content": "Not as content-rich as Persona 5 Royal, or even the original Persona 5, which is frankly to be expected with a spinoff. The roster of available personas is rather small, the game basically tells you what to do and prevents you from doing anything else, and the social link/confidant system present in the main series is replaced with a watered-down bond system. However, the flair of Persona 5 remains, and it's very flashy, especially with the hack-and-slash gameplay. All-Out Attacks, Showtimes, and the series's signature \"persona eyes\" all add to this game's style, without the need for much graphical power, allowing this game to run on lower-end or older gaming PCs. Fair warning: the plot will not make a lot of sense without the context of Persona 5. As I do not have a PS4, I watched a let's play of the game instead (I am told the anime sucks). If you have a PS4, or are one of the lucky ones to get your hands on a PS5, I recommend you play Persona 5/P5R first, otherwise you won't have context. It is unfortunate that P5 or P5R are unavailable on Steam, but it is understandable if Atlus signed an exclusivity agreement with Sony. Overall, If you enjoyed Persona 5, you will likely enjoy this, and I recommend the digital deluxe edition, since for $10 more, you get $15 worth of DLC in addition to exclusive bonus content.",

However, do not make the mistake I did of trying to play it with mouse and keyboard. I typically prefer to play everything m+kb, but this game made me switch. Even after rebinding all the keys, the combat is still a nightmare on keyboard. It's very fast paced, so I always hit the wrong buttons, it's difficult to do follow up attacks and showtimes, and switching characters is way more effort than it needs to be. It's playable with m+kb but the experience was infinitely better when I switched to a controller. I'm sure people can do it, but I would recommend using a controller.",

        "content": "This review is from someone who also played the original Persona 5 game as well as P5 Royal.\nIt's good for what it is, which is a game in the genre of Dynasty Warriors. In my opinion it is best played on the harder difficulty. That being said for some fans of the Persona series who played and loved P5 and Royal, this might be a bit disappointing. It feels like a slightly gutted version of P5 unfortunately.\n\nThere isn't really any sort of Social Link/Confidante mechanic. As such there's zero instance of the archana system for fusing Personas and the strategy behind it. There is also no real time constraints like in P5/R (which might be very welcome to a lot of people, I get it). For me, those were some of my favorite aspects of P5/R as it allowed you to really get to know the various stories of many great characters.\n\nThe game's story so far is enjoyable though, having taking place I think half a year after P5/R. There is no canon choice for things like romances, Royal's characters, etc. The style is still there and amazing as always in the new and changed environments and characters. The soundtrack is great like usual.\n\nAll this being said, even though I'm disappointed in some aspects of the game, it's still very enjoyable so far for the genre it's in. I don't usually care for Dynasty Warrior-type of games. If I had to give it an arbitrary rating out of 10, it'd be a 6 or 7 out of 10.",

        "content": "A fantastic game and a brilliant followup to Persona 5. By far the best Persona spinoff we've had yet.\n\nThe fusion of Persona with Warrior style gameplay works great, the presentation genuinely makes you feel like you're playing a mainline title, except it's an Action RPG instead of a Turn-based one.\n\nThe story is very similar to Persona 5's, but with enough differences and additions to make it feel like a fresh experience. Definitely not as deep as some other Persona stories, but still a good one.\n\nI played on Hard difficulty, and battles rarely felt \"tedious\" or \"boring\" like a lot of people often accuse Warrior games of being (the only real exceptions being some optional bosses which act a little too much like HP sponges for my liking). I did find the difficulty jumped around a bit for certain bosses, where the boss of the semi-final dungeon was brutal to defeat, yet the final boss itself was a complete joke.\n\nThe music is, as you'd expect from a Persona game, absolutely fantastic. Lyn Inaizumi returns to sing for an almost entirely new soundtrack, as well as doing some Warrior's style \"Rock\" remixes of Persona 5 music (\"Last Surprise\" and \"Rivers in the Desert\").\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly stellar or anything, but they work well enough for what the game is going for (considering this games is also on the Switch). The art direction is as amazing a P5's was.\n\nApart from some HP sponge bosses and some occasionally crusty visuals, my only other complaint with this specific port is that I experienced quite a few crashes while playing. These usually occurred after long play sessions and weren't super often or anything, but still very annoying when they occurred and can potentially lose you a lot of unsaved progress.\n\nI'd also say I'd HEAVILY recommend playing the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this, as there's numerous characters and references to them that first time Persona fans wouldn't understand.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a solid 8/10. It's fantastic experience that Persona 5 fans will love, despite some difficulty and crashing issues. I hope we start seeing more Persona games being ported to other platforms now, specifically Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 FES (hopefully a remake for the latter!).",

        "content": "Purchased: 53 Euros (Voidu.com)\n\nIt's pretty simple, if you've played and enjoyed either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, I recommend this game.\nIf you have not played any of those, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game.\n\nThis game is for fans of the original who want more of the story. It's really a direct sequel to P5 rather than a standalone spin-off. The game takes place after the events of P5 and with the characters already having gone through a year of knowing each other, so it would feel more than a bit weird to be told 'welcome back' if its your first time there.\n\nBUYING IT NOW: So I ran into two problems that stuck out when playing. One was that the game crashed to desktop. It happened three times in the first 10 hours, but then never again, so theres maybe something buggy in the early locations? Or I got unlucky, either way, something to look out for early adopters. Second was that the game lagged quite a bit when multiple skills were used in quick succession, but by turning off ambient occlusion this problem seems to go away entirely and I got buttery smooth framerates.\n\nDELUXE EDITION: So I dont buy these normally, but I thought 'what the heck' for this one. So you get to play the game early (moot now), the 'all-out attack pack' which is just a bunch of starter items (little time saver but otherwise ignorable), and the legacy BGM pack (which I think is really worth it, one song from every prior persona game is included and the randomise function is customisable).\nTheres also the digital bonus content, which launches as a separate app from the game. The app itself is a little janky, but the soundtrack and art book are cool to have. Depending on how much you pay, might be worth it.\n\nBUT WHAT OF THE GAME ITSELF? \nIts a Dynasty Warriors style game. I have never finished a single Dynasty Warriors game but I liked this one from start to finish. The visual style of Persona 5 is carried over, along with a lot of the gameplay concepts. Yeah, now its a real time action game, but you still strike enemy weaknesses into baton passes into all out attacks. That part is still pretty satisfying. \n\nThe music is pretty great. Some pretty bombastic pieces to match the faster pace of the gameplay. \n\nWhen I finished Persona 5 and Royal got announced, there were 3 things I was hoping for. More Akechi, more Haru, and more hang out time with the gang. With Royal, I got more Akechi but I was still wanting for the other two. In this game theres more time with the phantom thieves and Haru gets some satisfying screentime. So Strikers essentially satisfies my desires. \n\nThe stakes definitely never felt as high as the original game, but its overall also a lot shorter than the original game. I finished the main story in 26 hours, but that might be an underestimate for the average. Theres still bonus bits to do in the game. Overall, its a fun add-on to Persona 5 that extends the story out further by one road trip.\n\nMaybe Persona 5 Royal will come to PC huh?",

If you're afraid that it's your typical Musou game, I'm telling you that it's not as it retains all the battle mechanics that originated from the main games; weaknesses, buffing/healing and even min-maxing your Personas in the Velvet Room to their highest capabilities. I recommend not getting it if you're new to the Persona 5 story as the it takes place right after the main games and this won't be the \"authentic Persona experience\" if you're looking to get into the franchise. All in all, it's a fantastic game. Here's hoping Persona 5 Royal will be released on Steam!",

So you can use this to stocking your Healing/SP Recovery Items. Cooking Ingredient also.\n- Combo let you use persona skills without spending SP. It's weaker but it'll save you alot of SP.\n- All teammate have their uses, But Sophia & Haru is highly recommend from how good they are. ( Just don't use Haru first boss ) \n\n\nThere're many downside for a console main game publisher/developer to be try out on PC, but i am truly welcome it. For i am a fan of Persona series for 10 years. Hoping for more Persona game to be release on PC.\nAfter 50 hours, i still want to play more and waiting for more things to unlock. It's a musou-like game, but is it felt like one? To be honest, no. I actually love the battle system more than vanilla P5. Despite being a fan of the combat system of Persona, it just hit me right to see your favorite characters combat in real time with flashy and REALLY EXTRA moves. I'm all about that extra moves.\nBut.\nThere're downside that i'm hope Atlus can fix and improve, i love the game, but it NEED TO BE IMPROVE.\n\n- Anti-alias is a joke.\n- Horrible basic keybinds. I change it the instant i am possible to. I don't blame them for how this is one of the first game they port to PC ( P4G don't have real time combat so the keybind don't affect this much and it quite alright. )\n- The game will crash from time to time, I crashed like 4 times in the past 4 days while in loading. Sometimes it could be truly horrible for how you're not saved after finish all request and going to the fight the Jail Boss. Cause we have to do it in one sitting. PLEASE FIX IT !\n\nI'll rate it for now, 7/10. If they can fix those that i said i would totally give it a solid 8-8.5/10\n\nPLEASE GIVE US DLC ! I buy the game pre-release full price AND I STILL WANT TO PAY MORE TO GET THE SKINS AND PERSONA. :( It's been a year of japan release but i still truly hoping for it.",

P5S continues the story of the original Persona 5 game based on where it's left off but has a twist that none of it's predecessors saw coming. It plays in a Musou fashion where you smack and annihilate enemies in real time combat. It borrows the same concept as Persona 5 where you can use your skills in the midst of combat. Being in constant 60 FPS, the game runs smoothly and feels natural to the touch. The story and voice acting is as superb as usual and it doesn't stray far from the original Persona 5 despite being a different type of game. To Atlus, Don't be afraid to release the other Persona games onto Steam. Many people look forward to it for multiple reasons such as not owning the specified console or in this case, introduces a lot of newcomers into the series. Persona 5 Strikers is definitely a game that's going to do very well so as for other future games that's to come.",

Characters, like the friends of the protagonist, are mainly there just to serve as gameplay pawns. They don't have many meaningful conversations or social events like in the main games. You cannot talk to very many NPCs and the different locations serve just as backdrops. So you strip away everything Persona games* are known for and what you're left with is... a hack and slash grind that doesn't even offer the risk and reward of Persona's time limited dungeons.\n\nI was actually planning to get further in the game before posting my review, but then I lost a hefty amount of progress because the game crashed. So I also recommend you take a look at the community discussions to see how many people are having issues with the port, random crashes seem to be really common.\n\nIt's not an awful game per se, it's just mediocre at best. If you need more of the Phantom Thieves and you're fine with the hack and slash type gameplay, then go for it.\n\n* = at least the newer ones",

        "content": "Fans of P5S will dig so much about this from the rejoining of some great characters, music from P5 and other Persona games, and re-exploring the themes and ideas that we found so interesting that we didn't just put 100 hours into P5, we put another 130 into P5R. However, I can't recommend this game because I just don't think it's very good on its own. I will probably play it to completion, but not because I think it's actually worth my time.\n\nThere's a scene early on where the old crew goes to the old hangout at their school and one comments about how it hasn't been that long, but they still feel a sense of nostalgia and I think that sentiment just about sums it up. I enjoy P5S only so much in that it reminds me of a game I rather enjoyed more and would likely have more fun replaying than honoring it in a sequel/spinnoff. P5S is weaker in just about every way. The story is rushed, the villains lack any depth, there is no buildup to the events that occur, and both dungeon crawling and combat have baffling design choices.\n\nKoei Techmo appear to have sort of mashed the Dynasty Warrior and Persona engines together, though one is custom and the other based on Unity. Combat plays like a DW game, but you are a team of four and enemies have the abilities and effects of Persona, at least for the most part, and theoretically this should work. One problem is that all the magic is range-based and so if you're attacked, it's usually from off-screen, and even weak enemies can have powerful effects. I spent an hour on one encounter because I had to fight alone and Pixies kept casting zio (lightning bolt) which caused stun and the duration was long enough for other enemies to punch me from full health to zero. I eventually learned that hit and run is the only way to survive.\n\nI am not a DW fan, but the combat just doesn't feel right in other ways, too. The camera is slow, controls sluggish, visuals to chaotic to be easily readable while being swarmed, you deal very little damage, and you're constantly switching between different characters with different control priorities and play styles. This could work if switching were seamless like Marvel vs Capcom, but it's not, or if each character was deep like and interesting enough for their own game like DMC5, which they aren't. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to say the combat is terrible, it's just not great. It's not a refinement of a good idea, nor a remarkable innovation. Okay, passable, not great.\n\nDungeon crawling is passable, functioning like in P5 with pseudo-stealth mechanics and platforming, though is mostly held back by long load times, even on my SSD. Whenever you find a checkpoint, you should leave the dungeon to heal up and immediately return and the only reason you won't is the loading screen on exit and reentry, even though each scene is fairly small and constantly reuses assets. This almost feels intentional because otherwise they could have made checkpoints heal you and you'd never have reason to leave the dungeon.\n\nFinally, the story: I won't go into what it's about too much because I routinely finding myself lose focus as dialogue flies by without developing much. The story is a thin wrapper around finding excuses to throw the team into dungeons and go on a road trip to find more dungeons. Learn that bad person exists, go to their dungeon, get blocked, defeat a mini boss, go back and defeat the real boss. Same formula as P5, just a lot more trimmed down. It also all takes place over a summer vacation road trip so you don't have any worries aside from someone being a bad person.\n\nVerdict: P5S is a toned down imitation of P5 that at times feels lovingly crafted, but mostly just a cynical cash grab made for fans and only fans.",

Additionally, the anti-aliasing seems to be broken and aggressively blurs the text and ui elements, meaning that if you want the models to look nice you need to either run a third party aa solution, or (as I did) run the game in 4K, which is pretty easy to do (because P5 is a PS3 game).",

        "content": "I absolutely fully recommend this game, it's a fun and great sequel to the original Persona 5 and I can tell you, you'll have a blast. Sure, the combat is different from the original but I promise you, if anything, the change is nice. \nThis game still has an absolute bunch of story and cutscenes for you to enjoy, just like the original game. I was surprised, I didn't expect it to be very story driven and expected much more of a dynasty warrior style all the way through, I'm glad I was wrong on that one though. While I recommend playing/watching the original Persona 5, you can still play this game without knowing it, you'll just be a little confused or oblivious to some references.\nI'd say if you want just story, it's about 30-ish hours but to complete it (achievements, etc.) would be more like 50. Less content than in the original, but expected.\nThe new characters that are introduced fit the team perfectly and I really like how every single member has their own unique way of fighting, it's fun to change it up here and there. One of my favourite parts is that you can play as any of the cast (you'll always be Akiren/Joker for the social stuff and for main story, though) and they all have their own unique animations and cutscenes, it's just a whole lot of fun all the way through.\nI am the same as everyone else hoping that Atlas decide to port P5/P5R to steam, but for now, this is a really nice way to scratch the itch for Persona players and fans alike.",

As someone who generally prefers turn based RPG combat, I have to say that playing this more real time action combat was a nice change of pace and generally a great time. The characters are as lovable as ever, the story is gripping and intriguing, the soundtrack and art is absolutely phenomenal, and the game play is a total blast. I would absolutely recommend picking up this game, it's well worth the price, and if you're a fan of the Persona series or action RPGs, I can almost guarantee you'll love it.",

I'm running this game off of an NVME SSD that loads other Triple A games in seconds, but this game legitimately takes minutes to load everytime I see a loading screen. \n\nThis game is also way more difficult to run that it should be. At 2560x1440 on a GTX1080 with a Ryzen 9 3900x, I can not play this game at a locked 60fps even at low settings. For comparison, I am able to play Monster Hunter World at mid-high settings at a locked 60fps at 3440x1440. There's also no uncapped framerate option, no ultrawide support, the rendering resolution scale doesn't do anything for me, there are barely any graphical setting tweaks and overall this port is a mess. But that's just a Koei Techmo game for you. I hope ATLUS will do better going forward because Persona 4 Golden was pretty well done, but that was also a PS Vita remake of a PS2 port.",

But if you have played, then this is a great game to continue the story. \n\ncombat is a bit different obviously but it is not welcomed. theres still the hack and slash element (which is ok but for me can get tedious) but the persona element that made combat interesting in the previous P5 titles does the same for this combat style. in my opinion, it makes the combat that much more interesting to me. combine that with combos that differ from each character, i defintely am a fan of this style of hack and slash combat style.\n\nonly cons that ive found is that you dont see many characters from the previous game (which i get because this is technically a brand new game but come on, we get to walk around town a bit, i wanna see some old faces!) and dialog is pretty linear which is everyone's main complaint im sure (i just want to romance Makoto again - big sad). but other than that, the story is interesting and the new characters are as well!\n\nanyone who buys the game, the only recommendations is git gud at the dodge mechanic and really play into to weaknesses of the enemies. do that and you should be golden!",

        "content": "  Seeing the Phantom Thieves back in action is something I wouldn't expect for the Persona series, being the first to have another adventure with the same group of characters just makes me happy to experience all the moments of the group of friends from the last game.  Besides all that I enjoyed the different kind of combat that I haven't experience for a Persona game, since I have played Hyrule Warriors before I must say I enjoyed Persona 5 Strikers more since it had all the battle mechanics like all the other Persona games.  The music, I absolutely enjoyed the new tracks, even with the original Persona 5 sound tack made it feel so nostalgic, even adding past games was also nice to randomize the tracks for every battle you get into.  Anyways I loved the game!  even though it took me 5 days to complete!",

        "content": "[h1] Persona 5 Strikers completed review [/h1]\n\n[h1] Disclaimer [/h1]\nThis is not a spin-off of Persona 5, this is a sequel. For any newcomers on Steam looking to enter the Persona series, I do not recommend this game as an entry point. The game assumes that you've played Persona 5 and understand the group's dynamics and past because it does not explain it to you and constantly references the OG Persona 5 game. So this is a review of Strikers from a fan of Persona 5 instead of a newcomer.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe Phantom Thieves goes on a trip around Japan! Strikers does a great job in giving the player more group interactions and is also an excellent tourism advertisement for Japan. Not much to say here without spoiling the story, but any Persona fan who wants to see more Phantom Thieves will get their money's worth.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nThis is the part you're probably looking for. The collaboration between Omega Force and P-Studio brings the Warriors gameplay to Strikers. However, unlike Hyrule Warriors, this game does not utilize the same overall gameplay as the Warriors series. You will not be going around a big map fighting generals with your army. Instead, Strikers plays [b] exactly [/b] like Persona 5, but it's now an Action RPG. You navigate the map similar to Persona 5, slowly approaching enemies to ambush them. Using Personas, you target weakness to down your enemies and execute an All-Out Attack. Show Time also makes its return from Royal. This core gameplay loop will be familiar but now it's cooler and more fast-paced because it has action elements in it. If you love the gameplay in Persona 5, you won't have a problem here.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nBecause it's an Action game now, the Strikers remixes have more electric guitars in it and sounds 10x more energetic. It's amazing. I'm listening to it on repeat already. If you love the Persona 5 OST, you can add the new songs into your playlist and jam out even more.\n\n[h1] PC Port [/h1]\nThe PC port is pretty average. Nothing significant to note of its settings; it's the same settings you expect from a typical PC game. The game also caps at 60fps, so no unlimited/120/144 fps. One important thing to note is that this game does experience some random crashes when loading a new area/going into another menu, based on mine and my friends' experiences. Save often to ensure you don't lose much progress when one does eventually happen.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is definitely a game you will want to play as a Persona 5 fan. By no means is this some insignificant spin-off, it's a sequel that Persona fans will want to play like how Royal is. I'm happy that Atlus (probably with help from KT and Omega Force) decided to put this game on PC and I hope that it's a continuous sign of more Persona games coming to PC. Also, after finishing this game, if this game gave ideas to P-Studio to make future games as Action RPGs, I'm [b] all for it [/b]. HEE-HO!",

        "content": "So far (5 hours in) this game it is really good and worthy of being a follow up to P5! The soundtrack is very addictive just like in the original, and the Phantom Thieves are back in action along with Sophia, who I really like a lot so far and is a great addition! I have been a fan of spin off dynasty warrior type games such as the Pirate Warrior games and Hyrule Warrior ones and so far this one is my favorite, it really keeps the JRPG elements of P5 with the twist of being real time action, not just mashing the attack buttons a lot but also being able to use your gun, and even your persona for special moves, and all out attacks as well! As a big fan of Persona 5 I can say that this is worth it! If you havent played P5 or P5 royal first you should to better understand who these characters are!!! Also you should because it is amazing and worth every minute of your time!\n\nI am sure Persona 5 (or royal or both) will be added to steam after this and even with P4G here.  I'm guessing the focus was completely on this game, and fixing the bugs for now as well! It seems almost sure they will add P5 since they added P4G and I just think it will take time for the port and hope it gets added soon! :)",

        "content": "All the charm of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal with a new and flashy combat system, some may compare this to a warriors game or even refer to it as a warriors game because it is done by Koei Tecmo but honestly in my experience its more of an action oriented JRPG, it has the familiar attacks/personas of previous games but this time its all done in real time combat opposed to turn based.\n\nAlthough i'd highly recommend playing the original Persona 5 first before playing this the story thusfar seems to only have a few callbacks to events that happened in Persona 5 but that could change further in, if you wanna know the cast of characters you're playing as and get accustomed to the Phantom Thieves and what they do I think its crucial to play Persona 5 to have a better understanding of whats going on as they might throw around some unfamiliar terms or even reference characters/themes that only appear in Persona 5.\n\nI hope that the success of this on PC will convince Atlus to port Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal over so that you can experience its story in full as this is technically a sequel to Persona 5 and as a PC player there really is no official way to play those games.\n\nOverall i'd give this game a 9/10 and I hope if you do decide to pick this game up you enjoy playing it!",

        "content": "Wow.  I just...wow.\n\nLet me be clear.  I [B]DESPISE[/B] Persona 5.  As a huge fan of Persona 3 and a \"meh\" fan of Persona 4, Persona 5 felt like a straight up slap in the face, doing everything in its power to irritate the player.  Cats forcing you to go to bed, a bunch of time management worse than your day job, less-than-memorable cast (this is mostly due to the padding which was another issue), etc.  Royal comes along - I skipped it due to censorship (yes, it's censorship).\n\nI was on the fence with this.  But I watched someone play briefly and was intrigued that it seemed to better respect the player's time than Persona 5.  What I didn't expect was to walk away feeling so energized from the experience, start to finish (mostly).\n\n[h1]What I Liked[/h1]\n\n\u2705 It's not going to win graphics awards, but it's good for what it is, and (with the exception of transition screens) runs at 60fps.\n\n\u2705 It's a [B]MUSOU[/B] game.  Some will say \"no it isn't!\" - because they don't understand the true intent of a Musou game. It's to clear out enemies.  That's all you do here.  No school, no chores at home, etc.  Just clearing out enemies and doing events to unlock the next area.  The thing is, Omega Force did an AMAZING job with the skin this time to basically make a \"role playing Musou\" game.  That's what this is, and it's pulled off so well I was shocked.  The characters in P5 \"felt\" like they should be in a fast-paced action game rather than a turn-based slog, and here we are.  It just feels like a perfect fit; battles are fast and furious once you master the various mechanics.\n\n\u2705 You can use all of the previous (non-Royal) characters.  There are also two new ones you meet along the way.   Each has a different and unique play style, from melee to Persona spells to even guns (slingshot, for Mona).  This lets you basically create your own fun, choose your characters, and have at it.\n\n\u2705 Absolutely NO padding.  None.  There's nothing to sidetrack the story and nothing to distract from the storyline (which is a sequel...more like an epilogue...to P5).  The result is, you're looking at 30 hours if you rush.  Which is actually a very good length for a game of this style.\n\n\u2705 Pacing is near perfect, as things progress when you want them to, and you're given plenty of warnings when things are going to be missable.  It never feels like a slog.  Also, despite the fact this is essentially a road trip, you'll not be seeing irrelevant nonsense like Final Fantasy XV, so even there it's got it down pat.\n\n\u2705 Challenge is decent without being ridiculous (see below for a note though).  Here's where they do Musou right: enemies will actually make an attempt to kill you, but it's usually the larger enemies that are hiding partially behind the mobs. \n\n\u2705 The last boss and final sequence requires a bit of belief suspension, but given this is Persona, I'm willing to give it a pass.\n\n[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]\n\n\u274c It is true that you should AT LEAST watch a \"Let's Play\" or read a synopsis or something before playing this, because it throws you right into the action.  There should have been a recap cutscene at the beginning.\n\n\u274c I'm not a fan of some of the sidequests/Requests, because they fall into the \"Dragon Quest IX\" pitfall.  For those that don't remember that terrible game, it would have a quest that says \" kill three Wolves\".  You're like, easy work....but then it's like \"ahhhh, but wait...you must use this technique that fails 95% of the time to  stun them.  Oh and they only come out at night.  Good luck!!\"  In other words, BS requirements.  There's a number of those, mostly from the Velvet Room (make this Persona with this spell where you have navigate through a clunky UI to even find it).\n\n\u274c It will intermittently crash.  It seems to be very memory picky, because every time I experienced a crash it was when memory was challenged (due to other things running).\n\n\u274c There are a lot of places that have a prompt (sign, whatever), where you can't actually ever go there.  I can't stand when games do that.\n\n\u274cThe AI tends to be a bit stupid sometimes.  More often than not, I'd look over and see two out of three of them dead for no clear reason (Mona should heal, but doesn't consistently).\n\n\u274c Some of the Jails are a bit irritating to navigate simply because they require you to do a lot of backtracking for switches or whatever, which I also can't stand.\n\nI say these things but I'm serious when I say, this is SUPERIOR to Persona 5 or Royal.  From a presentation perspective, you expect the Thieves to really be in an action game, and that's what this is.  But it's also a role-playing game.  Don't overlook it because it's got Musou applications.  If you enjoy role-playing games with some action, this is worth your time and money.",

        "content": "To start off let me get my thoughts on the game out, this game is great. It's not amazing, but it is great. I am not a fan of the dynasty warriors type of game play usually, however this game re-imagines that concept with the different characters and abilities in a way similar to Hyrule Warriors. The story and characters are just as lovable as they are in Persona 5. A small issue that many people have with this game is the lack of social links and confidants seen in previous entries in the series, but this game makes up for it in its fast game play. This game is not the same game as Persona 5, it's its own game. The fact that you can exit and re-enter the jail to fully replenish your health and sp on the same day without being forced to sleep is a great part of this game and the jails are absolutely massive. You're given access to almost all the characters right out of the gate and introduced to both of the new members of the group very quickly. At the moment, I am close to completing the first jail and am thoroughly enjoying the fights and have yet to feel the fights as tedious. The boss fights are especially fun as they require you to use a little bit more strategy instead of just spamming X X X X X Y. \nOverall at the moment, I give this game my rating of a:\n8.5/10",

This is a direct sequel to the original Persona 5 (not the Royal expansion), and it takes place a year later. The music, as usual, is fantastic from the moment it starts, and jumping back into this world feels like reuniting with an old friend! \n\nI'm an avid mouse & keyboard gamer but I would definitely recommend connecting a controller for this game. I used a PS4 controller and it was extremely easy and streamlined, just plug it into the computer with a micro USB cable and you're ready! The game switches seamlessly between mouse/keyboard and controller input & display depending on the last input it detects.\n\n60fps Persona is a dream; this and the P4G PC release are both proof that this game series deserves simultaneous PC releases from here on. One downside right now (as of 2/23/21 at 10:52PM) is I've had a handful of crashes, usually on loading screens. Be sure to save frequently!\n\nIf you're not a Persona fan because you hate fun or you have bad taste, then this game might not be for you..,",

        "content": "Got this early with the Digital Deluxe Edition and I've got to say I've only really encountered two issues in my nearly 20 hours of game time. I've had one Crash to Desktop after a save, thankfully it loaded me into the next cutscene when I loaded it back up, and sometimes the background music breaks up a bit. Other then that, it's a decent Warror's Lite game that I would say is actually more Persona instead of Warriors to the point I can actually tolerate it a lot more then a traditional Warriors knockoff game.\n\nEDIT: By the time I finished the game at 45 and a half hours with no real grinding, I had a second CtD that occurred under similar circumstances as the first time. Game had a lot more content in it then I was expecting and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I hope we get some actual DLC for this game down the road! Oh I had also played with Borderless Window on a TI 1080 card.",

        "content": "Things to do before playing: Play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game, trust me the game is better knowing the events of Persona 5.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStory: Amazing, always had me engaged, but at times it dragged on with Jail Scenes and made the game feel a bit slow at time because of it, but not too much of a gripe to be too mad about.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay: Addicting and makes want to keep playing. You will struggle with this game if you button mash, which I like. It \nmakes you learn when to use certain skills and when to use just the character's base attacks.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReplay Value: Great replay value for 100% completionist and people who want to do Merciless Difficulty. (i'm doing that rn and it's really fun so far! Just make sure you prepare for it before going in.)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPost-Game: Persona 5 Strikers can offer around 5-10 hours of post game content before NG+ is unlocked, and I actually really like it, it gave me something to do even after you beat the Final Boss. The post game can challenge your skills with the game so far and really put you up to test with some of the content they give you during post-game.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPC Port: This PC port is not great at all, through out my 55+ hours of this game, the game crashed many times and even set me back 3 hours one time. It could've been much much worse, but could've been so much better. I think Atlus should work on this field alot more in upcoming PC Ports of their games.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to Persona 5 and continues great story telling even if feeling slow at times with some pacing issues in the Jails. It also offer a lot after you beat the game like, a new difficulty, Merciless, a Post-Game that keeps you playing and improving your abilities, and overall is a great experience for those who have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. (Atlus port these please)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScore: 8.5/10",

        "content": "I didn't expect the sequel to Persona 5 could turn out so well to be released as an ARPG given the long-standing tradition of the series under a turn-based framework. In all honesty, I bought this 'because it's Persona' given the usual depth and excellence in storytelling among the franchise, and the combat system surpassed my expectation of it being 'yet another Dynasty Warrior reskin but with a thrilling and compelling story instead of exaggerating magical power under a historical framework'. This adds up to my faith in the studio alongside the pre-sequel, my favorite JRPG. Amazing work there Atlus. \n\nMechanics-wise, what I admire the most is the smooth systemic incorporation of the inheritance from P5 under a new concept. It isn't like the Pokemon anime when the pikachu that could lead you to championship would turn into a lv5 noob just because the protagonist has entered a new zone. You face crowds of shadows here and there are real challenges in combat which could be entertaining - your build does matter here and it does not just take time to level up to wreck everything. Upon my first engagement in this game I was already advised to make good use of the environment, and this is totally true and essential in beating the game. You also cannot just lead your foes altogether and clear them up at once - the weakness system from P5 is still a significant factor to consider in engagement. The old and the new does not crash against each other but serve as complements to each other, this is unbelievably well-done. \n\nI am still first starting off with the game (6.7 hours of playtime upon the 1st day of purchase, and yes i have a proper day job) and on my way beating the first Jail, but I can see how well-thought-out the designers (and all the staff related to the development of this title) are in making the game already. \n\nI like Divinity: Original Sin 2 a lot and I have been considering it my favorite game of all times. I would say that Persona 5 Strikers is on par with the depth of DOS II but of another genre under the umbrella term of RPG, that it offers a distinctively different taste as an ARPG. Persona 5 Strikers features both active fast-paced combat and a youthful and engaging story while DOS II offers an interactive complex turn-based system and tells an exquisitely crafted tale. I know that they are completely different and go by different directions, but they are both ultimately guiding you through a thought-provoking and interesting universe.\n\nAdditional note: \nSpeaking of such, in my opinion it definitely reaches the level of NieR: Automata when it comes to the actions and controls, but the styles direct them to different kinds of audience. If you somehow feel like your young blood is boiling, this would be for you while NieR: Automata is to let you rethink what you want to do as an entity.",

There were some minor issues upon first launching it but they disappeared after restarting. The default key bindings are also very disgusting, definitely change them before starting the game as you can not change them while playing on a save :/ I ended up locking myself in the tutorial mission because I had \"gun\" assigned to Tab and \"lock-on\" assigned to Alt...yeah you can probably see the problem there.\n\nOther than that, just like every Persona game the characters/soundtrack/story are amazing! It's a lot of fun being able to play as other characters aside from Joker. There's a fuck ton of new mechanics in this game compared to all the previous games so you will have plenty to do/work on.\n\nHowever...from what I heard there is one major downside to this game...[b]why can I not romance best girl Makoto?? or any character for that matter?[/b]",

Admittedly, I'm not a fan of Koei Tecmo gameplay, but there's not much I wouldn't do for some more Persona 5.\nOne primary gripe so far is the need of tactical decisions in the middle of fast-paced action. It might have helped to incorporate less from Persona 5's battle system, as I feel managing afflictions and elemental weakness doesn't really work well in this gameplay.\nMy other gripe is that Sophia is just weird looking.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone wanting some more Persona 5.",

The RPG gameplay is like a stripped down Persona 5 and the combat has a good mix of action and strategy.\n\nBad things are the graphics options, random crashes, frame drops possibly related to Denuvo, lack of menu button during tutorial, wonky targeting and camera issues.",

        "content": "I'm just under 9 hours into the game and so far I'm hooked. The first four hours does a good job recapping the story for those with a passing familiarity with the story of Persona 5 (for best results play P5). It seems to I'd say all you need to know going into the story though is their general character types and that they're friends. The game mentions pretty explicitly other parts through this game's Sophie. Who wasn't in P5 and has to have things explained to her.\n\nPros:\nExcellent bit of nostalgia pandering in the beginning. It's been around 5 years since the last time I played P5 and played P5R as a light recap. So it was a nice reunion at the beginning.\n\nMusic is fucking orgasmic. P5 is by far the best music wise in the series that I've played and the only one I blast on my radio in my car on the way to work. The mixing is perfect too. It highlights the scene well without crowding the emotional scenes.\n\nThe first jail is long enough that you get a feel for how it's going to be playing the game going forward. It introduces a lot of new features as well as removing some too. For example, you can exit a Jail at any time and it won't advance time until you hit a certain story point. This mechanic is balanced by refreshing the items and enemies in the area, so it's possible to grind more effectively for certain types of items. They also took away the ability to use any corner or large object as cover making it harder to get ambush encounters.\n\nNot many bugs. I'm sure there are bugs to be found as in every game out there, but with this one it's possible to play the game as intended and not encounter a single bug.\n\n\nCons:\n\nThere are parts of the jails that seem built to pad the time you're spent in there. Instead of introducing a new puzzle for you to solve they will throw something at you immediately after throwing it at you for the first time. (Light spoilers for the first jail) there's a section where you're made to walk along a series of tight ropes to activate a pannel, then you have to back track and activate three generators in an area you've already been and that takes a while to get back and forth through.\n\nStory segments are significantly longer than in the other two games. The first twenty minutes are almost nothing but cutscenes and at the end there is a section where you transition from the opening to the actual game that hangs for a while and if you click away it seems to crash the game for most PC users. This is made particularly annoying by the fact that the first opportunity to save isn't for the first 30 minutes.\n\nThe on-screen information is a bit lacking. The problem with the eye-popping style of P5 is that eventually all the eye-popping information blends into the background. This system worked when the battles were turn based, and you could take your time and read it all. But Now that the action is real-time it makes it really hard to tell at a glance what information you need. Is Ryuji about to die or just low SP? \n\nHow the hell do I hear Mona saying it's time for a showtime attack when he barely speaks above the level of the battle sounds? And the notifier is the two buttons flashing below your health, but you have eight enemies stun-locking you into oblivion while you desperately mash dodge. That's not to say I hate the new system it's just not P5's battles and if you go into it expecting something similar then you'll be disappointed.\n\nConclusion:\nThat's about all I have. It's a mixed bag of fresh new things and the same old things you enjoyed about the older games. It looks like it's going to be a really good game from what I can see. I can't wait to see where it ends up.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a pile of trash that attempts to cash in on the Persona branding while ignoring pretty much everything that made Persona 5 what it is. \n\nAllow me to explain. Strikers has a very strange sense of 'balance', where most random encounters can be solved in a single hit by ambushing the enemy and immediately going into an all-out attack that just clears the screen. About the only time you'll ever get hit is if you don't pull off an ambush - which is common because the \"ambush\" button is the same as the \"power attack\" button and so half the time you'll wind up shooting the enemy instead of ambushing. You also more or less lose the ability to ambush enemies from behind: you pretty much have to be in a hiding spot and the range from which you can ambush enemies from a hiding spot is greatly reduced from what it is in Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nThen you have the boss fights, in which all sense of balance goes out the window. Most bosses can and will kill your party in one or two hits even if you're the appropriate level to be fighting them, and the party member AI is simply not equipped to deal with them. For me, most of the boss fights consisted of having my entire party die immediately followed by me taking control of whoever was left and alternating between mashing the dodge button and getting in one or two physical attacks before repeating the process.\n\nGone is the ability to creatively use spells or Persona fusion to address the difficulty: spells cost several times what they do in Persona 5 and your party members have less than a quarter of the SP they normally would have. The idea is that you're supposed to do attack chains that end in your Persona casting a weaker version of a spell for free.. except there's no easy way to control which spell it casts if it has more than one. I believe it's based on the number of times you hit the light attack button before hitting special attack, but it seems random to me.\n\nFusion is also significantly nerfed - there are fewer Personas in the game and a lot of them have been nerfed to the ground from P5 or Royal. There's no opportunity to get creative with fusion the way there is in the real game, where you can make a Persona specifically to address certain situations.. meaning that there will be situations where you simply do not have an answer to what the game is presenting you with. \n\nThe game tries to address this by giving you frequent save points, from which you can go through multiple loading screens to recover your HP and SP by leaving for the real world from the dungeon and then coming back.. instead of having, I dunno, a button that you can just press at the save point. Considering that you can use maybe three heals on a full SP bar (and each one heals maybe a third of your HP) this means you'll be seeing load screens a lot.\n\nThen there's the frequent issues linked to this game's poor implementation of Denuvo: random crashes, hanging on loading screens, slowdowns and frame lag. \n\nGive this one a pass until it's on deep discount.",

        "content": "Strikers is a very welcome surprise. While it may look like a simple Dynasty Warriors clone with a Persona skin, the reality is that this game has a LOT of depth behind it.\n\nThe action-based combat retains a lot of the systems at play in P5 and P5R - elemental weaknesses, technical attacks, status moves, buffing and debuffing, 1-More attacks, All Out Attacks, Baton Passes - you name it and Strikers has most likely implemented it in some fashion. In addition to the core systems, each character feels fantastic to play - each boasting unique movesets, abilities and progression paths, as well as displaying a lot of their personality in their fighting style. To put it simply, there's a lot more to the combat than meets the eye, and those who have previously played the original Persona 5 or Royal will appreciate the small details here.\n\nThe story so far (around 16 hours in) feels very lively thanks to the strong returning cast of characters as well as the two great new additions, Sophia and Zenkichi. The English version brings more fantastic performances which give the game a unique charm, and while the stakes don't feel too high at the moment, the relationships these characters have with each other make each moment feel endearing.\n\nThe music, my god the music. Straight up bangers everywhere. Do yourself a favour and listen to one of the new battle themes, Daredevil. If that doesn't get you excited to beat up some demons, I don't know what will.\n\nA caveat I will mention and the one gripe I have with the game do far is that ultimately it is a sequel, meaning it's difficult to recommend to new players who didn't experience the original game. You could probably enjoy Strikers by reading a synopsis of P5's plot and characters, but really you would just be doing yourself a disservice. As great as I've found Strikers as a massive fan of its predecessor, the lack of a PC port of the original makes it a very hard sell.\n\nIf you're willing to look past that, or you've already a fan who has played P5 / P5R, you will most likely fall in love with the Phantom Thieves all over again in Strikers.",

As a big fan, seeing strikers get a PC port meant more persona on PC and an instant buy from me. As expected, I am not disappointed. This combat, while it does take a while to master, is extremely addicting and is the highlight of the game so far for me. The story is entertaining as well, and travelling across a bunch of cities with the gang is a vibe. As this is the first game in the P5 universe on steam, playing it just really makes me want Persona 5 Royal on steam that much more. Seeing my favorite game get the port that everyone has been begging for would really be like a dream.  As for this game, if you're a fan its a must buy, but for others you do need to play vanilla persona 5 to understand anything in this game.",

        "content": "Wait a minute. Atlus released a new Persona game on PC? And it's day in date with PS4?! What is this madness?!\n\nBut it's true. If the message to Playstation fanboys didn't come through that Atlus PC ports are here to stay, this does now. This is now Atlus' second PC port they've done themselves fresh off of Persona 4 Golden (which they did a fantastic job on and you should go buy and play that game now. Do it.) Now Koei Tecmo did codevelop the game, but the good news is they had no part in the port at all. It was all Atlus. KT only made the combat mechanics, while Atlus made the rest of the game.\n\nSo how does the port fair? THEY MANAGED TO MAKE A PC PORT BETTER THAN P4G, in such a short amount of time too! Atlus is a newcomer to the modern world of PC gaming, and they're already making ports like seasoned vets. Everything is fast, smooth, and fluid, and runs amazingly. If the port for Strikers is this good, then the eventual port of Persona 5 Royal will be even better. (Seriously Atlus, get on that.)\n\nSo, what is Persona 5 Strikers? Well, it is the sequel to Persona 5, only instead of a lifesim turn based JRPG, it's a musou, but don't let that discourage you. It's a musou designed for people who don't like musous, like me. It plays less like the traditional Warriors games and plays more like a Persona game that's real time action instead. And man they nail the power fantasy. You feel like a slick badass as you slice and dice through massive hordes as your favorite Phantom Thieves. One thing to note: If you're expecting the social life and RPG mechanics the Persona series is known for, you're gonna be sorely disappointed. Strikers is action and action only. Don't let that discourage you from buying it, because when going through the massive levels it plays like a big action oriented Persona game. That's not a complaint, it's a warning.\n\nStorywise, it's really big for what is on paper just a musou spinoff of Persona. The game is a sequel taking place six months after the events of vanilla Persona 5 (so storybeats from Royal will not be present. However the playable Phantom Thieves from Royal will be making an appearance as DLC later in the year.) It is summer vacation and a new threat emerges as wicked evil people are mind controlling people by stealing their desires, and it's up to you to beat them up and all their endless hordes. If you haven't played Persona 5 yet, do so before playing, otherwise you're gonna get spoiled hard, as well as lost on what is happening.\n\nBut that brings me to my biggest complaint of the game, and it's not the game itself, but the release. The Persona series finally broke free from Playstation exclusivity, and everyone is hype off the heels of Persona 4 Golden wondering what's next? Would Persona 5 come next? That's a logical move since Persona 5 is the hot new game everyone's raving about. Well instead, the game we got was the sequel to Persona 5. People really want Persona 5 Royal and have been begging for years to come to other platforms especially PC so we don't have to emulate vanilla P5 through RPCS3 anymore and could support the devs. But instead we got this game, a game that probably won't sell well on PC since we don't have the first game to go off of. My only guess to this is SEGA wanted Strikers to get a PC release first since it was coming out next, and they're basically playing catchup. But man, does it sting STILL not having Persona 5 especially since they know we want it after they made that press release about the emulator C&D. All I can hope is that Royal gets a PC port announced soon, similar to the missing Yakuza games getting announced for PC a month after Like a Dragon released. We need Royal on PC ASAP, especially for this game.",

Honestly, not the most in-depth review but for someone who has entered the P5 universe with this game, I am having a lot of fun; definitely recommended!",

My only complaint of the game is that it can easily just deteriorate to mashing the attack button and I don't know what i'm doing half the time. Maybe that will change after the third dungeon. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5/royal and wants more persona content and happens to like action rpg or musou elements. \n\nGameplay 8/10 \nMusic 10/10\nVisuals 9/10",

I can't say I agree with Atlus that people who didn't play persona 5 can enjoy this game just as much, it kinda just throws you in expecting you already know the characters. Still, great game with fun combat and I am glad to see more persona on pc. Bring persona 5 Royal to pc cowards.\n\nEdit: Game is unplayable after the 5th boss, I have tried every fix online and nothing has worked. Hopefully the fix this soon\n\nEdit 2: Fixed by using the hotfix beta they mention in one of their forum posts",

Honestly I wish they would have just made this with the regular battle system. It is so much better than this musou stuff. So far the battles have been kind of a joke. I was over two hours in before I had even taken any damage. There are also some REALLY long cutscenes.

It was quite hard for me to get introduced to the new mechanics such as abilities, fast forward, ect.\n\nIt's worth mentioning how Atlus actually made a follow up to the P5 story and brings an amazing comeback to the Phantom thieves.

Playing Persona 5 beforehand is not required in order to enjoy and understand the story, but it is clear that you are expected to have played Persona 5 beforehand due to this game taking place after the events of Persona 5 and main cast being the same.\n\nAs someone who has NOT played Persona 5 (I've always wanted to... on PC/Steam), I hope ATLUS release Persona 5 on Steam so I can return to this game for a second playthrough to enjoy it to its fullest.",

And don't just watch a video online explaining it, I don't think the characters are as likeable as they are without the proper context.\n\nI had already finished this game on my Switch, but it was the Japanese version (since that was already released a year ago). And let me tell you, the ability to play this in 60 fps just makes it so much better. That and I can actually understand what I'm reading.

The story is definitely getting more interesting at this point.\n\nUpdate (13 hours in): The story is picking up now and the enemies are getting tougher. It's ramping up like a typical Persona game.\n\nReview in progress: \n\nAs a Persona fan, I can tell you this truly FEELS like a Persona game. \n\nThat means you get the best and worst of Persona in every form. I'm about 7 hours into Strikers, and the pacing is incredibly slow, just like Persona 5. This game mirrors Persona in the sense that it really doesn't respect your time, but it also mirrors it in having an interesting story, fun new characters that expand the Persona lore, and all of the usual hijinks you expect from the series. \n\nThe gameplay here is very novel and repetitive. They've adapted pretty much all Persona mechanics to a third person action game format, and that's rad. You get to play with the whole cast and level up their abilities. If you find the style of game fun, you'll have a great time. If you get easily bored of beating up large groups of mostly weak enemies, you'll probably get bored of Strikers. \n\nSo far, I feel like I can recommend this to Persona fans. There are some crashing and black screen issues, but you can work around them. \n\nP.S. it's still really cringy how sexualized some of the characters are, just like in every Persona game. If that cringe is enough for you to not like a game, Strikers won't be for you.",

It recaptures the same charm of the original while changing the genre entirely. If I had to pick out a flaw, it's that the dungeons, or \"jails\" feel very repetitive. They all have the same structure, unlike Persona 5's structure which usually included gimmicks.\n\nTL;DR:\nPlay the game, make sure you've played vanilla Persona 5 first.\n(Not saying you *should* emulate PS3 games, but persona 5 is technically a ps3 game and there are ps3 emulators online...)",

My only real issue is sometimes the special attack button doesn't register when you're doing a combo but it isn't a gamebreaker. Overall it's a pretty great persona spin-off that still manages to keep the charm and love that goes into the persona games as a whole.",

        "content": "I honestly was a little worried for this game. I enjoyed P5R, but I felt it leaned a little too heavily into fan service, and as a result wasn't as good as just regular Persona 5 (that and I'm still mad about how broken Okumura was in that game, but that's a different story.) This game though - I might actually like it more than Persona 5. The combat is fast paced and intense, where you're swapping between characters rapidly for follow up attacks, hitting weaknesses, and using environmental objects to beat down shadows. I never thought I'd get to play as a cat wearing a bandit mask on a skateboard running over Jack Frost, but here we are.\n\nThe social aspect of this game is definitely [i]different[/i] than in Persona 5, though I wouldn't say it's worse. It's a lot more based on exploring cities for cool moments with your team and building the team skills you want out of the social points you earn for spending time with them. The time system is also very different than in P5. Though the calendar still progresses, it moves with set story points rather than each time you leave a palace or spend time with a friend. Again, this isn't [i]worse[/i] than P5, it's just different. Strikers is trying to put a pretty decently sized game into one summer vacation, so they only have what, six weeks to tell their story? I think it took me more than six weeks to get my first confidants to max rank in P5, so I have to admit that this system works a lot better for this setup.\n\nThe real highlight for me so far though is honestly the characters. Persona 5 had some great villains, but most of them were irredeemably awful people, end of story. This game though is willing to tread into grey area a lot more willingly. You're going to face off against objectively bad people - but you'll also see why they became this way, how they're real people tumbling down slippery slopes of mistakes and bad decisions.  Without getting too much into spoiler territory, the two bosses I've gone against so far have had a lot more dimension than the earlier bosses of P5. This entire tangent is also ignoring the new NPCs who are on your side. I've found these characters to be quirky, interesting, and willing to add some life and spirit to an already vibrant group. Even the Phantom Thieves' dynamic feels a little more polished than in P5; The team, while still up to their usual antics, are calling out great kills by specific members, appreciating even Ryuii's accomplishments. I know, people not making fun of Ryujii. Who'd have thought we'd see the day?\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is a mix of funky new jams and the original P5 soundtrack on steroids. What's not to love?\n\nTL;DR: A sequel has a lot to live up to, especially if it's changing genres, and this absolutely exceeded my expectations.  I paid 10 extra dollars to play this game four days early and absolutely regret nothing.",

        "content": "Story Wise - I'm done with the first \"Jail/Big Bad\" of the game. Having about a couple of hours of grinding and stuff the game is exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Taking 6/7 months after the events of Persona 5, the Phantom Thieves are back in action! The gameplay is a mix of the general warriors style combo (2-6 light attacks followed by 1 or 2 strong) mixed with persona elements. Such as certain Combos like (2 light - 2 Heavy) casting a persona's skill. However if you are looking for more Hyrule Warriors / Dynasty Warrior game this might not be for you. Strikers is more Persona than Warrior. The RPG elements shine through with the different personas, cutscenes, and story. In reality if you changed to combat to be turn based again it would be almost a lightened version of the original, which isn't bad. It's really nice and the two styles of game blends well. If you like Persona 5 and want more story and willing to learn the combos and controls, I recommend it. If you like Warrior style games and want more of a JRPG elements, I would as well. \n\nFor instance, with most warriors games it's action, pick a level action, while with Strikers it's more here a  bunch of story, motives, and planning followed by encounters. The encounters are like standard JRPG run into an enemy and the fights start. The tutorial itself, took about 5 / 6 hours to get to the point of listening to all conversations talking with team-mates every day (Which can give items). \n\nI'd recommend this game in a heartbeat for anyone wanting more persona or a warrior style RPG. I never got around to finishing Persona 5 and watched a quick 3 minute lore video on Youtube. I'm in love with this game and can't wait to play more!",

        "content": "Wow, So, you get THE TEAM. You know? THE TEAM! Joker, Panther, Haru, Morgana, Fox, Queen, Jail Bait who is still unplayable, and the newly added Jail Bait v.2 The game is flashy and STYLISH in the typical persona fasion except brought to us in the form of a musou game. So you can hack slash bomb and punch your way to the new world without having to press X to guard the next attack. It mixes up the typical musou formula by adding elements that were present in p5 and takes on a truly unique spin to what a musou fan would be used to. What more could a fan want? This is the team we know, This is the team we love.\n\nWell...\n\nI cannot recommend this game to either a persona fan or a musou fan, If you are coming from a game like DW or WO where you get 50+ unique characters with different personalities, unique skills, unique weapons, and unique abilities to attach to those weapons you are going to be left wanting because here all you get is about 6 characters with unique personalities, Personas (skills) and Weapons. They have shrunk the formula here and made things much simpler in order to appease the original fan base (presumably, there is no document stating that) which failed in my opinion. Reason it failed is because the original fan base is still left wanting as well. There was so much potential to introduce new phantom thieves with this \"sequel\" The Doctor, The GunShop owner, The Teacher, Lavenza (who is actually 2 people)  all of them could have been included or added later and present a unique set of weapons and game play elements. The game is EXTREMELY repetitive which is typical for a musou, HOWEVER, usually you get bored try a new character from a roster of 50+ people and here you get to get bored and try a new character about 6 times, if you get bored beyond that you are SOL so you better REALLY enjoy a particular move set. \n\nHonestly...\n\nI could go on but that's about the gist of it. They tried to merge two different worlds and ending failing both of them. Which is sad cause i really do love these phantom thieves.\n\nThanks & Good Luck\n\n",

The gameplay is very fun and what makes it even better is the fact that they made each and every character's kit and moveset completely unique on top of the mindblowing soundtrack (which is basically a given in any game in the franchise) and design. I am playing on hard difficulty just because I didn't want to blow through the game in a day and it pretty tough for me, as someone who hasn't really played this genre of game at all. But despite that, I've never once gotten irritated at failing multiple times in a fight, rather I think about what I could do differently until I figure out what works and what doesn't and amidst that, memorizing the movesets of the enemies until I eventually complete the encounter, feeling a sense of accomplishment after several failed attempts. That however is only the tip of the iceberg, it takes some of the core things from vanilla P5 and incorporates it quite smoothly into itself, which in turn makes it feel like a true successor to vanilla. For 60$, I honestly believe that this game is worth every cent. 10/10 would cat van again.",

So far I've encountered about 10 crashes of the game sometimes taking hours me back multiple hours of progress because of long sections of the game not allowing you to save and or me forgetting. If this is fixed then I'll change this review but until then the crashes are so frustrating at this moment in time it's simply not worth it.",

        "content": "This game is absolutely stupendous! A MUST buy for anyone that loved Persona 5! If you did not play the original game, then you will have absolutely no clue what's going on, and I appreciate that. They don't spend any time going over past events and treat the player with respect that this is a sequel and prior knowledge is necessary. \n\nThe gang is back together and they are just as charming as they ever were - arguably more so because no time needs to be spent on introductions, so they can just leap straight into playing off eachother as close friends. Just seeing these characters reunite brought a lump to my throat. So far, the writing has made each character actually feel slightly more impactful than in P5 as they seem to be all pulling their own weight in conversation and nobody is getting left behind *cough Yusuke/Haru*\n\nThe style is BACK, BABY! The menus are still incredibly satisfying to flit through, the all-out attacks feel better to enact than ever, and the new additions are all extremely welcome. The combat feels absolutely joyous and I have zero complaints about the change from turn-based to frantic hack and slash. \n\nMy only recommendations to the devs would be A: add widescreen support and B: give me better sound mixing as the effects seem a little too loud and drown out the music and VA which are both exceptional.\n\nThank you Atlus for bringing this game to the rest of the world and to PC!!!! Keep this up!",

Worthy sequel to Persona 5, though it simplifies a lot of things for the purpose of transforming the game into a hybrid visual novel/JRPG action game. Highly recommended, and hopefully Sega ports the rest of the SMT series to PC ASAP.",

One of the best soundtracks I've heard.. feeling H Y P E D all the time fighting Shadows \\m/ All of their SHOWTIME is LIT. For people who played Persona 5 you will really feel nostalgic.. and you will just long for a new Persona game. \n\nI've come to appreciate other characters even more because you get to see a different side of them. (don't want to spoil anything)  Their fighting styles are unique (DUH) so you never get bored of the game (especially with the Last surprise song lmao)\n\nI really recommend this to people who played Persona. and for people who are curious and never played Persona 5 or any persona game **COUGH** There's persona 4 Golden in steam **COUGH**  but just wants to kick ass, steal hearts and want to taste a bit how a persona game works.. then this game can be added to your Library! You'll eventually like the characters though if you really wanna know them more then play Persona 5! (or maybe watch the Anime? lol)  \n\nbut yeah overall i love this game <3 and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

And the story is fun, nothing mind blowing from what I've played, but it doesn't have to be, it knows what it wants to be, and I think it achieves what it sets out to do very well.

        "content": "Cleared the game (as of 03.25.2021) but will keep the review spoiler free.\n\nPros\n- A legit continuation of P5 (not P5R). The story illustrates the growth of the Phantom Thieves and is fantastic. \n- Killer soundtrack. My favorite is Blooming Villan, River in the Desert, and Counterstrike. \n- Doesn't chug on 60 FPS. \n- The new characters, Sophia and Zenkichi, are a fantastic addition to the cast. Usually the new characters tend to hog the spotlight or something but not too much with these two. \n- A Musou game that blends P5's style and system very well. \n- The right amount of difficulty. Once you cleared some hurdles, the game offers you the Merciless option (Risky in JP) and that'll definitely challenge the player's skill (to illustrate how hard Merciless is, you might die in the tutorial if you think you can just waltz in and tank everything). \n- New game plus option.\n\nCons\n- Map navigation might be a bit disorientating at first since you'll be going up and down and all over. I definitely got disorientated at the Shibuya Jail.\n- Inventory management could use some work. You'll be spending a good minute looking for the right recovery mid-fight. \n- You can't jump between Jail to Jail. This might be a bit tedious when you're trying to clear some requests. \n- The chaotic nature of a Musou game might catch some people off guard if they never played one. \n- You won't be able to swap out members mid battle like you did in P5 so if you run into a mid-boss that your not prepared for, you'll have a hard time. \n- A lot of Persona's were cut. This includes the awakened forms of your teammates. \n- Though your main attack is physical, physical Persona moves were nerfed. In P5S, the cost to use the physical Persona moves are based off your total HP and the skill that mitigates the cost of physical Persona moves isn't available. So yeah you can't go mindless and spam Yoshitsune's Hassotobi to decimate your foes. \n\nMix\n- A lot of the P5 casts won't be returning here.\n- Morally gray bosses.\n- The game doesn't really teach you some crucial tips. For example, you can use your items to recover during combat. I did not realize that after a couple of game overs. \n- The bosses are paired with one of your party members for story (for example, Alice and Ann). However, there are two characters that don't have that kind of scenario which is a bummer. However, those two shine throughout the story in general so it's not a total loss.\n- Though it said you'll be going all over Japan, it's more of a slice. I did wish we could explore real-world Kyoto.\n- No DLCs. This isn't a deal breaker (and it's not like DLC = win button) but I did wish we could use P4's Izanagi or P3's Thanatos and jam to Raidou's battle theme. \n- You won't be able to fight against attendants like you did in past Persona games unfortunately (usually they're set up as a hidden boss). However P5S still does it right and prepared a fan favorite of the Persona series as the hidden boss. \n\nConclusion\n- This is a game that I definitely would recommend to anyone who loves P5 or P5R and who's into Musou games. \n- Unlike a generic Musou games, it's very story heavy and won't get as repetitive (definitely a fresh take for me at least). \n- You will definitely tumble in the beginning as you get used to the battle system, but once you understand and master it, it's very fun. \n\nPS\nThe game definitely suffered a messaging issue upon it's first announcement (a lot of people thought it was going to be a generic Musou game with Persona characters thrown in it). After the first and second PV though, I think Atlus got the messaging issue fixed and assured the audience that this was a legit Persona game.",

The dungeon crawling feels a lot \"stiff\" compared to its JRPG counter part. The camera is very very hard to deal with in tight spaces as well. \n\nPeople might be turned off by the fact that this IS a musou game, but the mix with Persona 5's JRPG elements make it so that enemies are not free roaming for you to bash mindlessly, and that enemies are actually more so just encounters you stumble upon. The Persona summons are definitely fun to use, however (and this is just a minor gripe on my half) SP in the beginning of the game is so scarce and that most of the time I am actually fighting SP-less. \n\nOverall, I am happy that this game is able to differentiate itself from other musou-type games, and it is definitely unique on its own. \n\nTo end off, Sophia is very adorable, and I think she's a great inclusion to the cast so far. I am definitely looking forward to playing more.",

I have more than 600+ hours played between Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal so this Strikers was an easy choice. \n\nThe game is new player friendly in terms of gameplay since there are a lot of helpful tutorials. \nThe story and character interactions will feel familiar for vets. I think this is one area that new players will miss out in terms of cohesion. The game feels like a true squeal, playing P5/P5R prior does make for a better experience. \n\nThe game doesn't have many bugs, if any. There is an anti aliasing issue with the in-game settings. It just doesn't look sharp to me. But this is easily fixed by disabling the in-game setting and enabling anti aliasing via Nvidia control panel. I recommend upping the resolution scale as well if your PC can handle it. The game looks incredible with graphical tweaks; literally go crazy in the NV control panel. The game is only 60fps so you can tick all the boxes and still performs well. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a worthy addition, highly stylistic, great soundtrack, lovable cast and the new gameplay style just works.",

        "content": "I came in to persona 5 strikers having played persona 5 (the original, not royal) and beaten it on a PS4. While I'm very excited to see more persona titles on steam, such as 4 golden, and 5 strikers, I really hope we see more of the main games ported. Persona 3, Persona 5, ect. If you've played and enjoyed persona 5, you'll probably like strikers. The same characters are back for a \"Vacation\" story focused around old friends getting back together.  The gameplay is solid, the anime cutscenes are high quality, and the graphics are very pretty! This game is great on the couch with a controller, or with a keyboard and mouse, although I prefer this as a couch title personally. If you haven't played persona 5 yet, you might not enjoy this game as much. I'm sure it would feel similar to joining a well established friend group, and realizing you kinda get most of the insight jokes, but that you also have a sense of loss that you weren't there when they were created. Regardless, story isn't the only attraction here, and the gameplay is solid enough that I can still recommend strikers to someone who hasn't played persona 5. That being said, Atlus, please give us persona 3 and persona 5 on steam. The whole \"Steam vs other platforms such as epic\" argument might sound shallow on paper, but steam is offering so many wonderful features that no other storefront can. A big example of this is Proton support, which allows windows games to run on linux. Valve is hardware and software agnostic, allowing many gamers to come together and enjoy their favorite titles in the way they'd like. I'm happy to support Atlus on my platform of choice, as it is a platform that supports my freedom of choice. Here's to more wonderful persona games coming to steam in the future. We're glad to have you here! \n\nBest Regards, -PR0XIDIAN",

And guess what - It's still good old Persona (even without social links), with same memorable characters, fantastic design, and incredible stories. I\"m just only 6h in the game, but I know that I'll have a post Persona hangover after beating it. \n\nThere is only one big flaw - If you didn't play P5, you may be lost in the beginning, and Strikers will definitely spoil you great P5 story. My advice - if you don't have access to P5, just watch anime based on game.\n\nBTW. I cannot understand why this is a direct sequel to P5, but no to Royal?! Knowing Atlus we should probably expect Persona 5 Strikers Royal.",

        "content": "You can play as your waifu, turn into vehicles to mow down hordes of cute persona designs, and bop to some solid music tracks from all persona games. I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\n\nOn a serious note, this game brings a trimmed down, but still immensely enjoyable version of Persona 5's overworld, with a twist for the combat. It translates surprising well to an action based hack and slash. There will be an adjustment period for anyone who's previously played a persona game because several of the button assignments are different to compensate for the new combat (like the persona summoning menu is now a special attack button).  The platforming is also no longer on rails for the most part, so movement is a bit more choppy than it was in persona 5.\n\nHowever, after an hour or two of getting used to fighting, its a surprisingly rewarding experience. It emphasizes reflexes and situational awareness to dodge attacks and use combos to fire off skills seamlessly. As well as rewarding persona building, because having the right set of skills to hit weaknesses or apply crowd control can be the a major factor in how smoothly a fight will go.\n\nHard mode even provides a pleasant challenge, forcing you to pay attention in most encounters, or else you most likely be overwhelmed by enemy abilities and attacks. Forcing you to really dive into the combat system, and learn to string together combos and dodging efficiently.\n\nI was expecting something good as a spin off, but it went beyond my expectations into a great game to play on its own. A legitimate 9/10 from my time with it so far.",

        "content": "This is what we want Sega/Atlus, more Persona and other games ports on PC please.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent and at the start I thought it was just a total cash grab due to the price but this is a genuine Persona game even with the involment of Koei Tecmo in this game. This is actually what a non Turn-role Persona game would be like. It is more of a Persona game than a Dynasty Warrior clone.\n\nThe game takes place after the event of Persona 5 during the summer vacation as the Phantom Thieves yet again find theirselves in another quest to change hearts.\n\nGameplay; Smooth 60fps locked. No drops. it is to be noted that some cutscenes are running at 30fps but there isnt many of them. The key bindings isn't that bad and it is easy to learn them and can be changed if you need to. The combat is very fast paced and the mechanics are well implemented. I'd give it a 9/10.\n\nGraphics: They are not bad but also not superb due to something that looks like a lack of strong AA but overall they are fine. 7.5/10\n\nSpecs needed: This game is not very demanding and even 700 series GTX cards can handle it fine as long as you tune the settings a bit. 8/10.\n\nMusic: Now this is the part that is actually an absolute hit. If you do buy the digital deluxe edition you have access to battle ost from previous persona games ranging from Persona revelation up to Persona 5 Strikers. The sound quality in Persona games is alway top notch and this one delivers as well. 9.5/10.\n\nFinal thoughts: Should you buy it? I would say wait for sales because, the standard version really doesn't shine like the digital deluxe edition with all its bonuses. However, for long time persona fans, I doubt this will be too much of a concern to them. I should also mention that , even if you did not play Persona 5 this is not an issue as this game seems to be a total different setting. Also thanks to Koei Tecmo for making this game with Atlus.\n\nMy overall score: 8.5/10.",

        "content": "With this game being in a somewhat unique situation, there's three main areas I want to address in this review: playing this game without playing Persona 5, the state of the PC port, and the game itself. \n\nPC Port up first! The port is very simplistic unfortunately. No ultrawide support, capped at 60fps, and limited settings to adjust (there is an internal resolution scaler though, which can go up to 2.0). The port runs well though - I have an 8700k and a 3080, and I've had basically a locked 60fps at 1440p with all settings maxed and the scaler set to 2.0 (and I haven't hit any bugs yet, but I've only played for a few hours). I imagine that this game will be able to run on a very wide variety of PCs, which is good. One minor complaint I do have however is that the UI is pretty big, and there's no option to re-size it. It's not too much of an issue when running around the world, but during battle it very much gets in the way. \n\nWhat's not good is that you really shouldn't play this game if you haven't played Persona 5 (And like many, I am absolutely baffled that they haven't brought P5 to PC yet. Especially with this game being a direct sequel). Not only will you spoil some great P5 moments for yourself, but this game doesn't really do anything to hold your hand story-wise. It does some very baseline \"story setup\" in regards to the overall world and lore, but it very much assumes that you've played Persona 5 (or are at least very familiar with it and the characters). So if you haven't played, chances are that you'll have no idea what on earth is happening or who any of these characters are. \n\nAs for the game itself, so far I'm enjoying it! I'm not completely sold on the combat yet (which I'll get to a bit later), but the game feels like a legitimate Persona 5 sequel. I don't know how much of a hand that Atlus had in development and how much was Omega Force, but this game feels right at home with Persona 5 in terms of the writing and character interactions. As always, the voice actors have brought their A-game (I'm playing with English VO) and they do just as great of a job as in P5. Omega Force has introduced a few new characters as well, and they all feel like they just fit right in. I'm sure you'll have heard about Sophia by the time you play, and yes - she is as precious as everyone says she is. \n\nHowever, don't go in expecting a full-blooded Persona game. As far as I'm aware, there are no confidant levels, no school, no social stats to level up, etc. While this absolutely feels like a proper sequel in terms of tone and design, just remember that it's a Persona-themed hack and slash game, and not an actual Persona game proper. And with that, we come to the combat! Which is hard to give a full opinion on because I've only played the game for a few hours but I'm going to do my best to give my thoughts as I have them. \n\nConceptually, I love combat (also as a note, I'm playing with a PS4 controller so I'll be referring to it for the button layout). Each character has standard attacks that you'll button mash with the Square button, a special attack (that can be weaved into combos) that's mapped to Triangle, and their persona which is summoned by holding down R1. Hitting Triangle will do different things depending on when it's used in a combo. Using Triangle does something different than if hitting it after hitting Square 2 times, or 3, or 4 (each one presents a different ability). While each character performs combos in the same way (each character has a Square + Triangle combo, a Square + Square + Triangle combo, etc) they do different things for each character, and it can be a bit overwhelming to keep it all straight. However, I imagine that this will naturally dissipate as the game is played for longer. \n\nWhen holding down R1 to summon your persona, battle freezes - this lets you choose your persona/ability and choose the area to deploy it at your leisure. You can switch between any party member at any time if they're in your current party (you're still limited to 4 party members, but these party members can be switched when not in combat), and you can even run around as your chosen party member while in the Metaverse, which I really like. When a typical battle starts, you'll run into one of 3 enemy types: general blade fodder, personas, and \"boss\" personas. The blade fodder are just faceless enemies that you can hack and slack your way through, and don't present any challenge at all. Personas are the personas that we know and love from P5, and this is where you'll want to use the correct party member/persona ability to target their affinities. \"Boss\" personas (I put boss in quotes because it's not an actual boss, they're just tougher versions of the normal personas) can take multiple affinity hits before getting knocked down, and are generally tougher to kill/do more damage. \n\nThere's a lot more to combat, but that's the elevator pitch. Why am I hesitant on it? Because honestly, at times it feels very frantic and unfocused. As mentioned at the beginning, the battle UI takes up way too much of your screen. It's at least 1/4, if not 1/3 of your screen real estate. Add to that all of your party members mashing their standard attack and sending off persona abilities, plus the enemies are doing the same, it results in so much visual overload that I can barely keep track of what's going on. The game recommends trying to use different party members to chain together combos and such, but I can barely keep track of what's going on - there's no way I'll be able to chain things together efficiently. It's also difficult to keep track of your own health - the in-game characters will sound off voice dialogue to let you know that your health is getting low, but sometimes you miss it with the amount of stuff happening on screen and it all just feels a little hectic. \n\nAll that being said, I'm still enjoying the game thoroughly. This is about as close to a \"Persona 5 2\" as we'll ever get, and it's a damn fine follow up. When you're only facing a few enemies and can actually pull off the combos that the game wants you to, it's very satisfying. I'm hoping that my problems with the combat will go away as I get more used to it, but only time will tell there (I'll most likely update this review after finishing the game). If you love this world and these characters, I highly recommend playing this game.",

I suggest not looking at them.\n\nThe port's not amazing, (there's a range of graphics options hampered with a 30/60 FPS cap) but it's absolutely serviceable. The game itself is a fun twist on the Musou; instead of territory control like in the Warrors games, you're getting a fun twist on the usual combat mixed with some fun dungeon crawling. A very easy recommendation for anyone who enjoyed the main game.",

        "content": "Updated March 8th\n[h1]WAIT FOR A PATCH[/h1]\nFinished the main plot. The game and the plot is top notch but wait for a patch. I will definitely recommend this game if atlus at least spent time trying to fix these problems.\nMy loading time got fixed after updating the driver. However, I start to run into random crashes in my after-run. Most frustratingly, usually after boss fights.\n________________________________________________\nUpdated March 5th\nAfter keep searching on the forum and elsewhere, I finally solve the problem by updating my graphic driver. Although the fix on the forum says that to roll back the driver to 460.79, I was on that version of the driver, so I tried my luck updating the driver and it surprisingly fixed the problem. It was hell of a journey, and I don't think this game is worth recommending to others unless there is a patch coming out addressing all the crashes and porting problems.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdated March 3rd\nI cannot proceed to play the game. I got stuck after the boss fight in 5th jail. Infinite loading black screen. Funny thing is every time I close the game I can here a bit audio as if the game has not crashed. This is a problem faced by many other players and I have tried all kinds of fixed but none really worked.\n[spoiler]I have fight my copy for more than 10 times now and I am literally speed running the boss fight. I am tired.[/spoiler]\n\nI have point out many other bugs brought by the port but none really affected my experience this much. This one literally caused me not able to play the game anymore.\n\nI love the game and the series. But seriously, fix the port Atlus.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAs many reviewers said, it is very hard to get onto the game if you are a new comer to the series or, to be more specific, you haven't played the previous game Persona 5. If you want to fully enjoy this game and cannot get your hands on P5/P5R, a good place to start is to watch the Animated series [url=https://p5ausa.com/]Persona 5 The Animation[/url]. Although the quality of the animation isn't the highest, it covers all the important stories and can get enough background information to not get lost playing this game.\n\nAs for the game itself, so far so good. Need to play more to see if this game can match or even beat P5.\n\n\u81ea\u5e26\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4f4e\u4ef7\u533a\u6bd4\u6e2f\u670d\u6253\u6298\u8fd8\u8981\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n\n[Updated after 10 hrs playtime]\nAfter finishing the first part of the story, I have a general grasp on how the game is played and can say more on the performance and gameplay itself.\nThere are some flaws to the game, including relatively longer load time comparing to other games and to playing it on PS5 (I am running this game also on a high-performance SSD). Especially when I load up the game, it usually takes me 10 to 15 seconds to actually be able to play the game. I am not sure the problem can be fixed, and it is rather minor problem, but this will be frustrating after more hours of playtime, which I know I will be having. Another thing that stands out to me is that although I am playing this game on a controller, the character can only move along the 8 axis using the left stick. This is definitely bad porting, and I haven't experienced anything like this on other ported games like Yakuza series or Atlus' own Persona 4 Golden.\n\nGameplay is solid so far, but also missing out on a lot of thing that really made persona series stands out from other JRPG games - daily interactions. While the game still using the calendar system like its predecessors, there are less layer to that because you are free to spend however long time you want in one day and do whatever you want. Being able to go and return palace (jails) freely without worrying about time passing is more player-friendly, but it feels like cheating to just freely go in and out to recover your hp and sp.\nUp till this point of the game, I haven't had any side stories and bonding time with other characters. The city has much less things to explore and places to go. Although it seems like we got to visit more cities, so that might still be fun.\nI guess I just miss the time to spend with all my [spoiler]waifus[/spoiler]friends and school life.\nThe fighting is fun, and the way the incorporate the old persona system to this musou type game is very interesting.\n\nA solid 8/10 so far. Definitely recommend if you have played Persona 5 before, and worth to play if you haven't and don't mind missing out on some stories or spend time watching the anime series",

        "content": "ive had a lot of fun so far!! the persona battle elements keep it from being like other hack and slash type games, so if you're not a fan of those this might still be worth a try. the story is a direct sequel to persona 5 and it doesn't offer much explanation so definitely play that before picking this up! ive had minor issues with crashing and a few animations are a little wonky, but otherwise its a very good game - just be sure to save often :) here's a few fyis for people playing:\n\nthe preset keyboard controls are a nightmare. i highly recommend using a controller, but if you really don't want to then be sure to go into config and reset them to whatever works for you. once you get past the main menu you have to play through the entire prologue before getting the chance to do it again so this is super important if you dont want to be reaching over to press H and N constantly! \n\nyou can leave the metaverse at any checkpoint, with no time penalty. if you're low on sp just leave and immediately come back, there's no reason not to. you should also be using healing skills more often than items, because there's essentially an infinite supply of sp. save your healing items for battles.\n\nsimilar to the last game, its best that everyone stays alive, even if they're at 1 hp. losing a party member means losing a quarter of total damage. however, in this game, joker dying isnt an instant game over. to lose, *every* party member has to die, not just the protag. if the character you're playing is low on health, switch to another. the ai will automatically keep them away from danger (mostly) and you can get back to fighting.\n\nyou start the game with joker, then unlock everybody else at once so it can be kind of overwhelming. every character is fairly well balanced so just play whoever you like most. i use ann and yusuke often because they're fast and do quick damage, but if you prefer more hard hitting characters ryuji and haru are a good choice. sophie and makoto are both a moderate between those. you unlock 'arts' while playing a character, which gives them new moves and other helpful stuff. once you've unlocked all of a character's arts, its good to switch to a new one so that you can have a party thats all boosted!\n\nin the game, confidants are replaced by a bond level. when your bond levels up you get bond points, which you can use to get upgrades. i highly recommend 'strength boost', which increases everyone's physical attack damage (essentially 90% of the damage you'll be doing), as well as ambusher and oracle recovery, which both restore hp after battles.\n\nfusion accidents happen CONSTANTLY, i dont know if its just my bad luck or something but it feels like 1 out of every 5 is an accident, so don't get too attached to whatever you're fusing.\n\nanyways its a really fun game!!!!! play it!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "content": "Please look up an AA fix before playing the game!\n\nThe AA in the game will make your text blurry, and not playing with AA makes characters in the near-distant VERY jaggy and unappealing alongside VERY jaggy text boxes (which wriggle about as you read). Tweaking it in the nVidia control panel fixes it completely and makes the game a wonder on the eyes. It's a shame that it has to be done, though, since that probably means the port quality is scrappier than I would've liked, but at least it's a relatively small and easy thing to tweak.\n\nOtherwise, the game's pretty solid so far. I'm surprised at how \"Persona\" it is, since I was certain that it was gonna be a Warriors game, with stages and missions, that just happens to have a Persona skin. Much to my surprise, it's not. I mean, it's certainly a Warriors' game, but not a 1:1 skin.\n\nEDIT: Also, remake Persona 3 and put it on PC pls.",

So far it has been a blast. My biggest problem is that the game has crashed 4 times on me but I save constantly so I only lost like 5 minutes total. Another problem I have is that I am not a fan of how the fusion menu is organized, you cannot select two Personas to slap them together but instead you have to find the two you want in the menu, and I feel like sometimes you can't fuse two together while in all the other games you can slap basically any two together to get something (obviously some trio combinations don't make anything in other games). \n\nDo not buy if you have a Windows 7 computer, the game will NOT open.\n\nput P3FES and Royale on PC so I can buy them again.",

Helped me make sense of things that I couldn't beforehand, therefore this series means a lot to me and because of the characters and themes of course :D \n\nPS: Synchronicity is my most favorite theory :)\n\nAnyways, the game does an amazing job catering to fans and the story does a better job at pulling your heart strings than the main game. Its amazing how the songs only get better and better with each new release :P Also, the cinematic after clearing the puzzles and then defeating hordes of enemies (especially if u play on hard mode) in the first jail is pure HYPE.",

So far in the little bit I have played I really enjoy the combat although different from previous titles, but it is a nice change to see persona combat like this. The story so far is amazing in my opinion and it does reference the first game but not so much that you can't get into the new title and love the characters as they are presented here. I can't wait to see what atlus has in store, and hopefully we will get Persona 5 Royal on pc soon which I think we will considering that day one this game is doing so well on pc, but that is just my theory",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is what a good spin-off should be. Takes the best elements of the original game and adds new twists to the gameplay/design to make something new. \n\nGameplay:\n\nI absolutely adored the turn-based RPG system from the original Persona 5 so I was a bit skeptical with the warriors gameplay that this game as going with. I'm happy to report that I was wrong and the gameplay works extremely well. Its fast, hectic, and makes you think about personas you should use instead of just using physical attacks. This is my first warriors game but If the rest of the games are this fun, I may need to investigate the series further.\n\nStory: \n\nThe story is your usual phantom thieves affair, taking them on a road trip around japan to new locations in the meta-verse. I finished my first play through of Persona 5 around this time last year so starting this game felt like a reunion with some old friends. The writing is on par with P5's writing and has already made me laugh out loud a few times already.\n\nPC Aspect:\n\nThis game runs perfectly on my 3070. You most likely won't need something that new to run it but it looks amazing with newer hardware. I haven't ran into too many bugs besides the occasional half-second stutter when entering into the meta-verse and some character dialogue sounding a bit drowned out from the music. \n\nOverall Thoughts:\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes what I loved about Persona 5 and makes something out of it. I've been grinning at every little detail or reference to the original game and it makes me feel like I'm actually playing full on sequel to the original game. I would highly encourage you to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal (Be warned, this game is a sequel to base Persona 5 so most story additions from Royal will not be present in this) before you play this though. Speaking of, I do hope that the success of this amazing PC port will get us Persona 5 Royal on steam soon. The Persona series fits perfectly on the steam platform and I'm down to have Persona on my PC. \n\nI don't like rating games with numbers but this is the exception. This game for me is a solid 10/10. Highly encourage you to play this game.\n\n",

        "content": "Game initially was a good homage to Persona 5 but soon became apparent it was not going to follow well in its footsteps. The game starts of strong with a strong opening and good display of the mechanics and gameplay but as you progress through the game you realise it is just a dynasty game. \n\nUnfortunately the game lacks substance. Its all combat oriented but even that is shoddy at best. The story within this game is extremely lack-lustre compared to its predecessors. The amount of actual story in this game is questionable at best. With the removal of confidants and making dialogue scenes more and more scarce there is no actual character development.\n\nThe game is also bugged. Even on a good rig the game still runs slowly and at one point the \ngame would soft lock you from continuing. To remedy this I had to try multiple methods that were convoluted just to progress. The gameplay at times can also feel clunky as its lock on camera and obstacles make it so that you character doesn't move freely or how you want.\n\nOverall the game isn't worth the price tag. Get it on sale. Or just play Royal. It has the content of a side story not a sequel so it is far overpriced. Overall if the bugs were fixed the story is just compelling enough for a P5 fan to want to play but it is not worthy of being a sequel as it lacks the substance Persona 5 had.",

The menu screens, transitions, animations are all amazing.\n3. The fight scenes feel very fluid while sticking to the Persona game theme very well. \n4. The story, this might be a personal preference, but I really do love the story. \n5. Mechanical skills and awareness feels rewarding. Dodging at the right time, using the right abilities on the right targets at the right time, it all rewards you in spades.\n\nI have some pet peeves with the game, albeit not enough to stop me from enjoying the game. \n1. The jagged lines and horrendous AA implementation kind of bothers me at times\n2. I can't find as many sort orders as the other games, kind of makes things harder to search for, when you want to search for a specific persona.\n3. Not sure if this is a bug, but there one time when two of the AI controlled members just flat out AFK'd mid fight. And then the other used abilities repeatedly which kinda sorta just healed the shadows. Forcing me to fight in a different way. (It happened just once to my knowledge and hasn't happened ever since, still, always in the back of my mind.)\n\n\nTL;DR, My grading for P5S\nVisuals          9/10  -  The game is a literal piece of art\nMusic            9/10  -  Some of the best game scores you can find \nCharacters    9/10  -  They will end up as a part of you. \nGameplay     8/10  -  Enjoyable\nStory             8/10  -  Engaging",

        "content": "A terrific game with great potential hindered by its custom graphic options (for custom graphic options, see the bottom).\n\nA Persona game in the form of action rpg, more notably similar to a Dynasty Warriors like system. Now, let's not get ahead and say this is a typical \"Musou\" game. It is VERY different and the differences (both small and big) are what make this game truly unique, interesting and an incredible game for a spin-off in the Persona series.\n\nEach character plays differently. That is, each relies on their own mechanic to be successful (eg. Skull with power attacks that can be charged and can reduce the damage he takes). Environments while recycled at times have placeholders for you to take advantage of (phantom dashes) and cities feel quite alive despite the lack of available interactions (most of your gameplay will be spent dungeon crawling).\n\nDifficulty determines how long you will have to grind the first (and possibly second) dungeon to be able to sufficiently tackle the rest of the game without experiencing too much problems. The story was to be expected like that of Persona 5 itself, but seems to strike somewhat more grand targets with the added anime tropes and flairs to give enough fan service. If the game isn't hard enough, you can unlock the hardest difficulty by beating the game. So there's plenty for those who want to do challenging runs.\n\nAction in this game will overwhelm you and greatly with how each character is played as the tutorial is rather basic (a small mixture of intro fights to reading the tutorials in the system menu). As you get used to the action, it will go from small amounts of frustration to mass entertainment as you unlock more mechanics and skills.\n\nPresentation. Just about everything in this game has been well done. Some voices can get repetitive when navigating the UI, but enough variety has been put in to avoid it. If you're a little bit on the nit picky side, some of the voice edits they have done have resulted in voices being drowned out near the final part of the phrase, immediate follow-ups, to minor grammatical errors (only found in dialogue). This is only a personal opinion, but if this affects you, just pretend you didn't see the text.\n\nMusic. If only the Deluxe edition actually gave you the music files instead of it being locked in the game, this would have made it perfect. The soundtrack is extraordinary, but to be stuck to listening to it in a 'separate' game hurts the experience. I'd love it if they made it fully accessible.\n\nNow for PC problems. The 60 FPS cap is regrettable to say the least, but messing around with any of the settings other than low/medium/high will often result in poor performances. I know there are fixes in the discussion forums, but to make it simple, only touch the first setting (low/med/high), and leave the rest alone (especially resolution scale as this one resulted in a few crashes ranging from losing 20 minutes to 1 hour of game time).\n\nPrice. Perhaps a lot was done to make this a reality, but the price is still extreme and I was seriously debating not purchasing it on price alone. It took a change of heart, but let's not go stealing desires Atlus.\n\nI am looking forward to see if they have plans for future spin-offs.",

Dialogue is funny, but has its cringe moments, so classic Persona.\n\nHow turn-based Persona mechanics would translate to the Warriors style gameplay was what I was most interested in when I heard about Scramble, and having put a good amount of time into Strikers, I can say that it flows together near seamlessly. There's a bit of a learning curve, I died a fair amount on the first few bosses, but once you get a feel for the flow of combat, you can string together some nasty combos. This made the second major boss feel like a cakewalk in comparison, not because it was easier in difficulty, but because I knew how to use my SP and movement more effectively. I'm near the end of the third \"dungeon\" and this pattern has continued. XP and money grinding is always available, and when the game says leaving the dungeon has no downside, it means there's literally no downside. Just wait like 1 minute for the cutscenes, then reenter to find all your SP refilled. This all makes it so that even if you suck like I did at first, you can still progress through brute force, though learning the mechanics is your best bet, as that one minute of Mementos' \"woahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoah\" cutscenes will get annoying.\n\nDefinitely a worthwhile pickup for fans of P5, and one of the best Warriors-style games I've played.",

I have been craving more Phantom Thieves since I beat P5, and this game finally lets the whole cast come together as an ensemble from the beginning, rather than slowly adding them.\n\nThis game has no romance or social links. It instead has the Bond system which is just a few passives for leveling another set of EXP which you get from pretty much doing anything related to your friends.

I'll put anything spoil related at the far bottom so if anyones not played, they can't see it. My pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-The combat is FANTASTIC. Going into this, I had a hard time getting used to it, because I was used to the slower combat from Persona 5, but this... hits so hard, literally. The combat feels so heavy, and that in my personal opinion makes games like this great. \n-The dialogue is cheesy at times, but there are so many moments that I laughed my ass off due to comedic timing, and just Yusuke being Yusuke. There are many screenshots I hold dearly from this game of the dialogue. \n-The music is OUTSTANDING. I remember hearing River in the Desert for the first time in Persona 5, and I remember how badass it sounded. But they literally looked at the original soundtrack, took the best songs and said: \"Hey, let's make this more kickass\". Believe it or not, it's more kickass. Rivers in the Desert, Last Surprise and most importantly, Daredevil, the 3rd version of Life will Change if you will. These songs made this game SO good, because you felt the pressure, and high tension. I listen to these songs out of game, they're that good. Also Sophia's shop's theme SLAPS.\n-The art style is so good. The cities you visit feel like a snapshot from real life and pasted into this game with a hint of that really colorful Persona style. \n-The bosses are actually really good. Usually in a game like this, there are a lot of lackluster bosses and the mini bosses are easy and boring. But they did something really interesting with the Request system, where later in the game, you can get requests to beat the boss of the city again, beat really powerful shadows around the area, or just farm. Personally speaking, I liked the Warden system, which are essentially mini bosses before the main boss. They give you a feel for the \"villain\", and give them character, which makes a good antagonist. (Sapporo boss is a meme tho, it's honestly funny to play, but fun)\n-Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are AMAZING. The devs took the idea of All-Out Attacks from the original game and pumped it with CRACK. When you see the way it's used in Persona 5 and can find it a little confusing on how you implement it in this game, and I was there at the beginning, but they managed to make it incredibly smooth, which kind of ties into the combat part, but this is separated because there will never be a better feeling than having finishing a strong shadow off with Ryuji leading an All-Out Attack and finishing it with: \"S E E  Y A ! !\"\n-The fact that you can play as the other characters is so amazing. Ambushing enemies as Yusuke, him saying \"I shall expose you.\" in the most composed matter, man, you can't ask for better.\n-THE GAME DOESN'T END IF JOKER DIES!!\n-Level design is SUPERB. This does tie with the art style aspect, but I just have to shout out how good the Shibuya level looks and sounds. The music and levels work SO well. \n-The new characters are so good man, I can't express how much I love Zenkichi. The way he plays off the rest is so natural and hilarious. Sophia is adorable and we must protect her. \n-It is mandatory to bring up Ryuji saying the F word. (Fun fact, the F word is used twice in this entire game, once by Ryuji, and once by a flashback shadow)\n-They started using 3D cutscenes and they are amazing, please do that more often Atlus.\n\nCons:\n-The animation is a liiitle weird at times. My main issue with this is how lifeless everyone looks when they're chilling in the van or just in cutscenes. At times it was just funny how their blank expressions would never change when they would chant \"Yeah! Let's infiltrate this jail!\". \n-The story is a little strange. It is a typical JRPG at times and it reeeally shows. I'll continue my thoughts further down. \n-The music is a little loud when you first launch the game, and you can't change it if you start a new game after a while of cut scenes, which leads me into my next point:\n-There are a little too many cut scenes at times. It was clear that there were a lot of shortcuts taken with cut scenes and how they skip around. I know this is a nitpick, but with how good this game is, that's really what it comes to. \n-The combat *can* get repetitive, but if you really think about it, that's the same case with Persona 5, but this game is about 40 hours shorter than the original. \n-I did mention earlier that the dialogue is amazing, but there was some dialogue that made me cringe. But then again, it's a typical JRPG in that regard. They could have cut down on how many times they say ones name when that particular person is upset or expressing something. \n-I don't know if this is just me, but I had issues with crashing. There were many times in my play through that I would beat a boss, relieved, then mid cut scene, the game would freeze and then crash. \n-The limited supplied for cooking is frustrating, but I totally understand why they did that, because cooked items are *busted* if you save them for future battles. \n\nShould you play Persona 5 before this? Yes. \n\nIs it necessary? No, but it is highly recommended, due to a lot of references to the previous games (except Maruki, like what) \n\nIs this game worth the price? Yes. I know that's up for debate, but honestly, you can get a *lot* of hours in this game, which is what makes games worth their price. If I'm being honest, I could've spent up to 70-80 hours if I 100%ed it, but I every request except the Prison mails. \n\nIs Deluxe worth it? As someone who purchased the deluxe, I will say that it's not necessarily worth the extra $10, but it is nice to be able to change your battle music and see art for the game. \n\n10/10 Game. \n\n*SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT*\n\n\n\n\n\n-The story is verrrrry similar to Persona 5, in the sense that you fight a god, again. I kind of see why they did that, but it was rather recycled, due to EMMA looking extremely similar to the final boss from P5. Was it fun? Yes, the only reason really is the aspect of splitting everyone into three groups to finish EMMA off. I will give kudos to that, which is a good idea for a final boss. I will say this: The cut scene of everyone finishing off EMMA in an All-Out Attack, is SO good. Everyone got proper screen time, including Haru. \n-Sophia going with Ichinose is so wholesome, it made my heart feel good :)\n-Zenkichi catching Owada is so heartwarming :)",

This game often references the past story/game and does not go out of its way to tell you wtf happened in the first game (you should play it tho, it's really good). The combat is much less Dynasty Warriors than anticipated on my part, it's deep and kinda challenging, especially at bosses. It's very story driven, so if long cutscenes bore you, you might aswell skip that game because this game does contain a lot of story only times with no gameplay at all.",

        "content": "10/10 game, now keep it up and bring of the Persona franchise to PC.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a step in a brand new direction for the entire Persona franchise, yet entirely fits all of the knowledge we currently have on the series. Every single translation of a skill from the JRPG format to the Dynasty Warriors format makes complete sense. The combat system feels incredible and flows perfectly with the styles of all of the Phantom Thieves, each of the Thieves' fighting style perfectly matching their character. The game also encourages you to use all of the Phantom Thieves (and no spoilers, you should it helps later on), beyond just using them to hit weaknesses.  The game may feel difficult, as bosses can have an insane amount of health if you don't have maxed equipment or the best Personas, but remember that the game encourages you to spend a lot of time in the Jails and that unlike the original Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal: [b]You can re-enter a Jail as many times as you want on a single day, refreshing your HP/SP every single time.[/b]\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nThe story is entertaining, and the new characters are welcome additions to the Persona 5 cast. The new Phantom Thieves fit incredibly well with the others, and their additions to the cast prove that it's not just high school kids who can change reality. There's a good balance of comedy relief with serious plot points, and the game knows when to take itself in either direction. Without spoilers, the late-game stuff can get incredibly emotional if you're invested, and again fits with the rest of the series while trying something new. \n\n[h1]Voice Actors/Thank You[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is the English VA's. You can tell that every single one of them was having a blast in the recording studio, and became the Phantom Thieves [sttrike]more than any cringy fan on social media ever could[/strike]. It wasn't as obvious to me in Persona 5/Royal, but in this game it was clear that every single voice actor was having a blast and completely invested in their characters, which was something that couldn't necessarily be given during a first game in a series like P5/P5R. As the characters grew, so did the VA's and it really showed in this game. To the English Cast, thank you for an incredible performance, and can't wait for the next one.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAll in all, wait for P5/P5R to come out on PC if you haven't played them already, or play it on PS4 since it's out there now. Persona 5 Strikers was an incredible experience that I can't wait to play over and over again to 100% and the point where I have every Persona completely maxed out. I'm incredibly happy to see that ATLUS doesn't need to make a JRPG to have an incredible entry into the Persona franchise.",

        "content": "The Phantom Thieves are back, just in a different way than fans of the series are used to. \n\nThey've been given the Musou treatment to resemble a dynasty warriors game, at least with combat. And the dungeons have also been simplified to match the new gameplay style, while retaining jokers ability to switch persona on the fly and some element of party management and group control / move selection in order to retain the persona series feeling, however has ripped away the confidant system to be replaced by \"bonds\", which are upgrade-able by the player at any point, each providing its own unique buff. \n\nThe game does try to introduce new ideas like this, however the concept is still the same as in previous games with antagonists becoming corrupted enough to create their own alternate reality. However there's a slight change here which allows the Jail Monarch to control people in the real world, forcing the Phantom Thieves to travel around Japan to stop them.\n\nThe story in Persona 5 Strikers isn\u2019t as compelling or thought provoking as its predecessors, yet the game is filled with fan service, and numerous references to the characters backstories and events from previous games, which for fans of the series is excellent and not forced, however for newcomers to the series will be just a tad confusing as none of them are explained. \n\nIt looks amazing retaining its slick punchy style and surreal colour schemes, each cutscene and special move have been choreographed carefully to capture each character's personality. In this regard Strikers still feels very much like a Persona game and hasn\u2019t lost any of its charm, with voice acting to match, it's hard to call this a spin-off, clearly time and effort was taken with this rather than just being a money grab. \n\nOverall, although it's shifted from its winning JRPG formula, the gameplay, narrative, story line and combat are all well worth playing through the 30 (ish) hour campaign for, however only for fans of the series, i'd generally say this is an awful entry point for new players, and to pick up p4 and p5 first.",

The way the Persona's work in battle is really cool and the soundtrack I got with the deluxe edition can be randomised in battles. I'm lucky enough to own Persona 5 Royal on PS4 too, so it's such a shame that people picking this up for steam won't get a lot of the context and throwbacks to characters in the previous game. If you have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, then I highly recommend this. \n\nAlso, this is a sequel to Persona 5, not Persona 5 Royal (massive missed opportunity).",

The story is also really good so far, and character interactions are top tier as always. \n\nIf you have not played Persona 5 yet, please play it first before this game. Its worth every minute of your life and it makes this game so much better by knowing the characters and their backstory. Or else, it'll be confusing and nothing would make sense.\n\nThe game runs smooth and rock solid 60fps on RTX3080, at 1440p maxed settings and 2x render scale.",

DLC packs for battle music enriches the game's already wonderful music.\n\nGameplay wise. it's definitely an interesting departure from turn-based combat. the persona fusion and real time hack and slash certainly spices things up.\n\nHighly recommend this game.",

        "content": "So I've seen a lot of great reviews, so this may just be a me issue but I need to mention it anyways because I love this game and want it to succeed as I have genuinely enjoyed it since fixing this issue on my own. \n\nThe control-scheme was very non-intuitive for the way they had it set up for people using mouse & keyboard. It doesn't play very smooth at all and I spent a pretty significant amount of time in the key-bindings menu trying to get things squared away. The issue was that there are so many commands, but the keyboard & mouse setup is designed as if you're just playing with keyboard, so the same buttons used to for left and right mouse are in the immediate area of WASD. This would be fine, if it didn't \"push\" other important commands to further locations from my hand on the keyboard, causing me to have to adjust my hand placement on the keyboard pretty regularly during fights until I changed the settings.\n\nThis isn't something that makes me regret getting the game, and I absolutely LOVE it now that I've adjusted things. Super fun and entertaining successor to the original game. \n\n*Minor Spoiler*\n\nJust wanted knew players to be aware of this concern I had because the beginning of the game is heavy on combat tutorials. So even though it was guiding me how to play, it doesn't change the ease by which you can actually play. This detracted from my ability to fully dive into the introductory plot. Something that I definitely think the company should attempt to update in the future or at least learn from for future games.",

If you go in with an open mind you'll be pleasantly surprised with what they've done here. While it won't have a great level of tactical depth as a turn based Persona game, stringing combos together, pausing the action for a moment to bring out your persona and use an ability, it's all very seamless and well done. I'm enjoying the game so far, it really is a bonafide Persona 5 sequel (not Persona 5 Royal sequel). \n\n[h1]-Story-[/h1]\nI am 18 hours in so this is an initial impression. The premise here is fine, we are basically moving themes from corrupt adults doing whatever they want to fulfill their own selfish desire to social media being a bad influence on young adults and making them do awful things to get over their complex and escape the judgement of their peers. Perhaps at the end of this there will be an in-depth commentary on the effect of social media on our collective psyche. It is serviceable enough in retaining attention, however, without going into explicit spoilers, I do find the recycling of some of the motives that compel the phantom thieves to do what they do to be frustrating. \n\n[h1]-Graphics-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Very Stylized \u2705\n    [*]Supports up to 4K \u2705\n    [*]Borderless, full-screen, windowed options \u2705\n    [*]Some text does not scale well at high resolutions \u274c\n    [*]Limited graphical options (bloom, motion blur, AA, AO, textures, shadows) \u274c\n[/olist]\n\n[h1]-Performance-[/h1]\n[olist]\n    [*]Runs smooth \u2705\n    [*]Potato friendly \u2705\n    [*]Coin toss on if you'll play 4 hours without a single crash or one hour and crash 2 times.

Gameplay is different than the original, but fun.\nAlso it's a bit more action oriented. Plus you do not need to bond with your friends like you had to in the first game.

        "content": "After 36 hours in I can safely say that this is not the Persona 5 experience I was hoping to get. The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n",

That's what Strikers is summed up simply.  It's got all the Persona flavor you know and love and feels like it fits in line as a great sequel.  Confidants have been replaced by Bonds but due to the way this one plays it makes complete sense.  Everything is more streamlined as you can quick travel easily between areas and transitions between screens/zones/The Velvet Room are much faster than 5.\n\nOverall: Still a great amazing game, maybe not as great as Persona 5 unless you prefer action RPG over JRPG in general. Also it's clearly made for those familiar with Persona 5 already.",

The gameplay is great, with plenty of story and dialogue mixed in with the fun combat. The story is a continuation of the original Persona 5, which brings all sorts of new characters, villains, and concepts to enjoy. I loved the original characters from Persona 5, and now they get even more time to shine. If you liked the original Persona 5, please check this game out.",

In around 18 hours of gameplay it happened 3 times. I lost around 2-3 hours re-doing stuff I already did because my game crashed. It really disrupts the flow of an otherwise really cool story and gameplay. \nThere is no autosave, which was understandable in the original game with its playstyle, but here (in a game where you can get in and out of the jails with no repercussions whatsoever on time management AND get refills for hp and sp for the entire party) is just dumb. \nThe crashes are a big problem that needs to be solved, but it would have been a tad bit better with an autosave function. Again, the game is good, but this is a major problem that needs to be a priority for the development team in a future patch (that needs to come ASAP).",

Yes.That said, I keep waiting for this game to become formulaic like its predecessor and it seems to be made specifically to prevent the player from getting complacent. Sure, there's a degree of predictability, but for the most part, it's a fun and unpredictable ride. \n\nWhat I've played of this combined with my experience with Astral Chain leads me to believe that, if Omega Force let themselves out of their own cage more often, they would easily outpace Platinum at their own strengths. Each game of theirs I've played since Dynasty Warriors 8 has begun to diverge further and further from the formula they used to strictly employ and it is completely for the better. Hyrule Warriors: Calamity was pretty good, but...I don't know if Atlus really knew how to draw their potential out of them or if they just were encouraged to just let loose and go wild but holy crap the gameplay feels great.\n\nCouple that with the soundtrack, which the mediocre tracks in this outpace some of the best tracks in the already stellar soundtrack Persona 5 had and you have a mixture for a game that frequently just hits the damn zenith for what an action game can make the player feel.\n\nAll that said, the game doesn't forget the series it's in. Many have said it's a love letter to fans of the series and it feels exactly like that. The plot builds on the characters they spent over 100 hours feeding us backstory and introducing to us, and Strikers serves to just show us how all of them have grown, both individually and as a group of friends who haven't seen each other for a year, but still kept in touch.\n\nI could honestly go on longer but I think the point is made, and I'd rather not spoil anything.",

        "content": "TDLR; Very fun gameplay but has only a decent story that gets the job done, has tedious grinding, and some pc port issues. \n\n\nBefore I start there're a few things I'd like to note. PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.",

The gameplay is still standard Persona 5, sneaking around ambushing enemies and doing all out attacks, but this time hack and slash instead of turn-based battles.\n\nThis game can be seen as a direct sequel to Persona 5, not the Royal version, and several references from the previous game can be found and it makes me so happy seeing those, so if you haven't played Persona 5 before chances are some jokes, and sentences might go over your head.\n\nAnyways buy this game, show Atlus how many people want Persona on PC, cuz' I don't have the money for a PS5 once Persona 6 eventually rolls out, and more people need to experience this game series.\n\nFutaba Best Girl, don't @ me.",

        "content": "Bringing this game to Steam was a good move, but players really NEED the original Persona 5 or Royal first. Atlus should port that next to be fair. With that said:\n\nIf you're a Persona fan considering skipping this game because:\n\n1)It's not \"real Persona/Megaten\"\n2)It's not turn-based\n3)There is no Social Link/Dating mechanic\n4)It's not The Royal (Although please do not play this before at least vanilla P5)\n\n\nPLEASE reconsider. This is in every sense still a very Persona game.\n\n\nTo say this is not true Persona is the equivalent of saying Persona is not true SMT. They are in the same family and are loyal to the spirit of the series. P1 and P2 did not have social link too.\n\n\nTrust me when I say Atlus has gone to great lengths to ensure this game FEELS like a sequel to Persona 5.\n\n\nThis game is missing some elements which might disappoint Persona fans:\n\n-There is no social link/confidant\n-Persona fusions are extremely streamlined\n-The combat is (obviously) not turn-based\n-The calendar system is fully controlled by plot, nothing actually passes time\n-SP depletes SUPER fast in the early game, but after a couple dozen hours I've begun to appreciate spreading out skills cleverly with normal attacks and combos. Leaving the dungeon to regenerate has no time penalty but is a bit of a time waster, should just have an option to skip the animation entirely tbh\n\n\nDESPITE THIS:\n\n-There's an abundance of \"social-like\" events and cutscenes, they're just integrated into the plot\n-Some are actually optional and are nice breathers very loyal to Persona fashion. Some of these are also in the form of requests/sidequests.\n-There's also a Confidant-like system that applies only to the Phantom Thieves. It's mostly automatic but there are actions you can take to increase the rank further. Rather than 10 ranks with set bonuses, you gain points to invest in skills of your choosing\n-The Palaces (or \"Jails\") are pretty well designed from what I have played of them and are much longer compared to P5 to compensate for the shorter calendar. They are HUGE. Plenty of verticality in some parts and nice platforming.\n-Yes it's simplified, but fusions are still pretty fun and skill inheritance plays a role\n-BUFFS, buffs are still important in this game. If you're skilled you can chip away at bosses with low level.\n-The combat is stellar and definitely not a pushover, because the Persona menu stops time, it somehow still feels like Megaten, you're just not taking turns... Play the game on HARD if you have the guts for it, you'll feel like a boss when clutching bosses with 1HP left. A well prepared player can literally NUKE bosses without taking damage.\n-Being able to control all Phantom Thieves and swapping between them in combos feels great\n-There are many more areas to explore since this game covers a road trip, incuding P5's Shibuya\n-Early parts of each Jail kinda feel like Persona 4's Intel gathering segments, but here there's a percentage on screen so you know when there's actual progress (less guessing)\n\nIn the 4 days of early access (Pre-Order) I've had 2 crashes to desktop after a cutscene. It was very random and I barely had any other issue.\n\nTips (You can probably ignore this if you wanna go 100% blind but there's no story mentioned here):\n\n-FPS has 2 settings, 30 and 60fps, I believe you cannot unlock this.\n-If your computer can handle it, set the resolution scale to 2.0x or at least 1.5x. At 1.0 the game's antialiasing is nearly non-existant.\n-Use the tutorials menu! It's the only place you'll learn combos and they're **CRUCIAL**\n-Shops restock based on plot and battles too, not just the calendar! Always check when you return from the metaverse AND make sure you know what shops have what so you don't waste yen. (YES even the vending machine trash is VERY IMPORTANT in this game, mostly early tho)\n-Just like items are important, don't ignore cooking. It's very good.\n-Use BOND skillpoints wisely. Money and Shop Sale are very good, but all of them matter.\n-Upgrading the shop sale BOND skill will restock the shop, use this very wisely!\n-Revisiting Jails has value as the requests system makes a return",

        "content": "Extremely great sequel to Persona 5. If you haven't played Persona 5 or Royal I recommend you play that first, because there's a connection to the original P5 and this game did not explain it, so you have to know the lore. Combat mechanics are surprisingly refreshing and fun. I am a big fan of old turn based Persona game, but the new mechanics are definitely worth the try. I came across multiple crashes when I play this game for more than 3 hours so watch out and save the game every time you can. Maybe the developers will fix this in the near future. Now I can finally be happy and wait for Royal port to PC :)",

And that a good thing. \nThe combat is fun and is solid musou action.\n\nthe world feels like a blend between musou and persona, open maps with parts to jump on or a city to explore and investigate. You wont get bored of the character interactions and when you enter the jail you can go where you want. Sneak up to a enemy and start the combat in a closed up environment that fixes the open musou combat from other Koei titles. Its more like a Jrpg.\n\nGraphics are great and the soundtrack is just phenominal. \nI have a lot of praise for this title and you should get it as fan of the series, Jrpgs or musou titles.\nits a perfect blend.\n\nNow sadly the game is not the best port. Long loading screens and sadly crashes.\nplus people having issues with fps and you cant play in full screen atm. (windowed works perfect).\n\nWith that said, i know they will fix it over time. And i'm here to review the game itself.\nIts a fantastic title.\n\nEnjoy the game !!",

That's Persona 5 Striker but Haru's here and you're off to a roadtrip.\n\nGameplaywise it's looks like a musou and standard attacks are musou like, however it plays more like an action RPG in the same vein as the FF7 remake, if not faster and more busy on screen.\n\nTrash mob is trash so you can musou however you want, instead the big meat is on mini-boss and boss fight where your standard musou square-triangle combo will never work because you'll get hit before finishing it,\n\nIn those case you'll go back to the gameplay of a Megaten game, where you'll use buff and debuffs (r), hit weakness using persona and keep yourself healed, all of this to break shields and initiate an all out attacks.\n\nHowever this time, unlike the turn base of a Megaten/Persona, you'll be actively dodging the boss attack in the arena while switching characters and using special moves granted by environmental objects.\n\nKeep in mind that's it's a full sequel to P5 (it doesn't explicitly show everything about P5 plot/endgame but you are expected to know the characters, their background,personality etc, so yeah it's not a point of entry game) , loading are a bit long even on SSD, and there's some weird issues with anti aliasing that makes the text ugly (removing it fixes that but the characters models in the menu will have jagged edges, it's totally fine in gameplay tho)\n\n",

Sure, there are some references and topics that fly over my head, but the game does a good enough job explaining the previous situation.  The music slaps, scenery and art style is amazing, and the characters themselves are very funny and interesting.  Yusuke is so extra that I smile every time he talks.  \n\nGameplay wise, the combat is so much fun.  I much prefer this over the fighting style of P4 (and I suppose P5 as well).  I love zooming around jails and jumping on things.  I also like the bonding system that P5S offers, once again, I prefer this over the individual character bonding that was in P4.  \n\nShould you play P5S before playing P5? In my opinion: sure, why not?  You may spoil yourself and not pick up on every reference or joke, but the combat and story is awesome and I highly recommend it.",

        "content": "It's really good. Every hour I played, I was this much sadder because I knew I was getting closer to the end. The combat can get repetitive and grindy, as is usually the case for Warriors games, but it never stops being fun, and through the ~45 hours it takes to finish, it doesn't overstay it's welcome. I've seen people say this is more Persona than Warriors, and I'm inclined to agree - after several hundred hours of the original P5 and Royal, everything just feels right here.\n\nStory-wise, it's good, and mostly standard Persona fare, but characters and plot from the original Persona 5 won't get reintroduced. If you haven't played that, be prepared to be confused, especially when the game drops the entire Phantom Thief squad on you in the first dungeon. You don't have to know Royal, though - no elements from Royal are a part of the story, so you're not missing anything in that regard.\n\nIt's also a good port, on a technical level. Performance is fine, you can remap all the buttons, even on a controller, and the settings menu has most of the options you'd want there. There is a 60 FPS cap, which is a real shame, but it's not a huge issue. I've had 0 issues with frame-pacing or screen tearing on a 144Hz monitor. Let's just hope Atlus realizes that PC is a good market to release your game on, and brings us Royal, P3, Arena, and any future spin-offs, since so far, their ports have been stellar.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is that Hifumi isn't in it.",

I had the chance to play it on PS in the Japanese version and loved it, so it's amazing to see that Atlus is finally releasing Persona games on PC, because they\u00b4re truly amazing. \nI'm also surprised on how well optimized this game is. Atlus learned from their previous ports and managed to release a pretty great port with no performance issues so far and smooth experience, even when playing with a keyboard. The only problem I've faced so far was a crash after like 2 hours of gameplay.\nAlso, love the fact that you can change the battle theme to other Persona themes like P3P or P4.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

Enjoyed the game a whole lot as a returning persona fan but a loading bug had prevented me from being able to finish the game. There is no workaround as of right now but the fact alone is pretty unacceptable. Please hop off the bandwagon and actually use your reviews to get this game in an acceptable state. Lesser problems include the fact that the antialiasing is terrible if you're playing on anything short of 1440p and the loading screens were already way too long for what they actually loaded into. Quite sad, hope it gets fixed soon so I can recommend this game again. (FYI if you haven't played persona 5, even when the ridiculous technical issues get solved, don't buy this. Play p5 first, ps4s aren't that expensive if you want to join this bandwagon so badly.)",

I playing on Hard Difficulty and honestly when I fought the first boss it took me a few attempts probably due to my low level or maybe lack of right skill for personas but I got it done, I honestly can't wait to replay the game on Merciless, which I believe it would be rewarded once you beat the game.\n\nGive it a shot and you'll definitely find it worth it or just not your cup of tea!",

They are spectacularly flashy, great characters and great turn-based combat. This one is different. It is a Warriors/Musou game. This entail huge battles and being overloaded by enemies. I love the combat and I strongly recommend this games to fans of the series or fans of action games.\n\nA caveat to this is that, it's a sequel. The game is 100% enjoyable if its you're first persona game or you've only played persona 4 Golden. It does have major plot spoilers to Persona 5.\n\nA problem that the game suffers from is it is locked at 60FPS. This game would benefit hugely from unlocked frames.\n\nAll in all its a stellar sequel to persona 5 and a great standalone action experience. If you've played persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal it is a must buy.",

        "content": "Sequels don't work, at least most of the time. Spin-offs are bad, at least as a general rule. And then, along came Persona 5 Strikers, which serves as much of a spin-off as a sequel. It is by no means a perfect game, no game is perfect, but this is goddam near it. Atlus could have re-skinned a warriors game whit Persona, and i would have bought it. Instead, what i got was a love letter to both, the Phantom Thieves and the Players. \n\nThis carries over a great deal of Persona 5. While some elements are shaved due to mechanics, most of them evolved with the gameplay change. Confidants are replaced by a bond system, you generate bond points trough certain requests or by fighting along characters. As expected the buffs from bonds are geared towards action games, more damage, faster bond growth, etc. At the same time this serves as a much friendlier system to the player, while still advances the narrative and deepens the bond between characters with the random personal request.\nAll the over the top action and showtimes are still present, and i must say, they are one of my favorite animations from the game, Atlus really brought out the personality of each Phantom Thieve trough this silly little animations. The combat itself feels fluid and gratifying, if at times a bit repetitive killing random trash. But where the game really shines is trough their boss fights. This has one of my favorite Boss encounters of the saga, and i thought it was nearly impossible to beat Futaba's Palace Boss. It could still use a bit more information on screen, like the direction and the type of incoming attacks from outside the screen, but it is by no means a deal breaker.\n\nThe downside to this game is, if you have not played Persona 5 OG you will probably feel left out on most of the conversations. A lot of references and inside jokes are beautiful winks to veterans of the saga, but might flew over the head of those not familiar with the lore, and i must say, this might lower your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall i will say, give this game a change if you are a fan of Persona 5, if you haven't played Persona 5 yet, i will still recommend buying this one, as it is a very good warriors like game, and despite the random reference you might miss, the game does a very good job at exploring the characters and the narrative is A+ as i have come to expect from Atlus.\n\nPros\n\n++Combat is fluid and rewarding\n++Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\n++4k 60fps\n++Controls are very good and have a variety of schemes\n++More P5 and Phantom Thieves\n++Story Rich as any other Persona/Shin Megami\n\nCons\n\n--Heavy loaded with references and inside jokes (not necessary to enjoy the game, but you do miss some of the enjoyment)\n--No TIa Takemi ( SRSLY NGGS where is ma TIA)\n--Somewhat short (about 40-50ish hours depending on how fast you rush it)\n--No costumes DLC (yes for this game, that is a Con, trust me on this one)\n\nAll in all, if you are a P5 fan this is a 9/10, if you are not, this is easy an 8/10. Buy it now!!",

I loved the combat, and like I said the story is just amazing. Overall this game is a 10/10. Zenkichi and Sophia are legends (If you can't tell by review I've already beaten the game) (Even though the game a bit on the shorter end, I still think its worth buying)",

I have played though this endlessly and i love this game, I love hack and slashes, I love persona games. This was a great combination of the two.. but.. My issue lies with how the SP is limited. While yes we don't have a time limit the check points feel a little to far apart.. so at times you may need to switch out party members and you may be stuck with a member who is at a major disadvantage for that section and if that character also doesn't have healing it can screw you over if your not good at this type of game. Its not Horrible but if you need to get outta there, and there's a story boss or need to take an enemy out so you can get to the checkpoint it can be nerve racking, and there isn't a lot of sp items.. but its all manageable with enough skill and yeah its still addicting.. and i'm almost done yeah i'm almost done the game i think.. so its also short but still very VERY fun pick the game up, steal hearts again and if you have anyway to play the original game (PLAY THAT FIRST PLEASE IF YOU CAN) play it and play this, i hope we can actually get one more game with this cast as i love them a lot and hopefully you will too.",

        "content": "Well, time to give a review on the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n[b]SPOILER FREE[/b]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nPersona 5 Striker\u2019s story is probably the most disappointing part of the game. Keep in mind that I did not care for the og Persona 5\u2019s story so I had some doubts about this story going in. I thought the story would be bad due to the same reasons I disliked P5\u2019s story, but the things that irked me in this game are different than what irked me in P5. The story is good. It plays with some ideas and themes that work very well. It has emotional moments that work well and the story sets out to do what it wants to do. That is be a summer road trip story around Japan with the Phantom Thieves facing a new threat. My problem is that the story plays it SUPER safe. [b]Spoiler:[/b] [spoiler]It\u2019s almost a repeat of og P5\u2019s story, which is a shame.[/spoiler] It\u2019s also very predictable. If you think to yourself \u201cthis person(s) probably the bad guy,\u201d you\u2019re most likely right. It\u2019s very easy to tell where the story is going. Again, it\u2019s not bad. I still very much enjoyed this story over og P5\u2019s. It just has so much missed potential that completely bums me out. \n\nWhatever the case, you NEED to play og P5 before this as the game 100% assumes you know that game through and through already. Hopefully, they release og P5 or P5R so pc players can play that before this.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nNow, THIS I can get behind. Like many, I had some fears going into this game as I felt this game would be yet another mindless Musou game where you spam attacks and win. And while spamming attacks can get you far pretty early on, it won\u2019t carry you much farther. P5 was half a JRPG and half a social sim. This game is 100% an action RPG. Some will be disappointed by the lack of social sim stuff, but I think the non inclusion of it allows for better pacing in the gameplay, and including it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the type of story and gameplay Strikers is going for. The new BOND system is a simple yet effective alternative to it I believe. The fighting itself lends itself so well to the warriors\u2019 style of combat. Persona elements like weaknesses, technicals, personas, etc mix so well with it. Each character is a joy to control and each one is just different from one other. Each one of them has their own gameplay purpose. The combat is engaging, and constantly asks you to stay on your toes and use the most of your arsenal since not doing so will result in you dying FAST. Try spamming the attack button on bosses or bigger enemies and see how fast you can die. Using weaknesses and technicals as well as knowing what combos to use is key in beating anything in this game.\n\nThe Jails (which are similar to palaces to P5) were all fun to explore and it was joy to see just how creative they could get. Seriously, most of them were fun going through, obtaining loot, doing requests (which are fun and rewarding except the ones where you have to go to an area without getting caught fuck those), and beating shadows was a blast. Some of the beginning Jails are a bit too close in structure for my liking, but the game quickly switches it up, so it\u2019s not a big deal. I do, however, feel that the game got a bit too easy at the end due to just how overpowered spamming weakness and technicals can be at times. I was playing on hard and while it was certainly ballbustingly hard early on due to SP drain, the game got a bit too easy at the end for my liking.  \n\nOther complaints include the lack of gun upgrades. I get the omission of social sim stuff among some other things, but no gun upgrades or customization? Why? That makes no sense since I actually like using guns in this game. Such a weird omission. Furthermore, persona fusing is super basic for seemingly no reason. I don\u2019t understand why they simplified Persona\u2019s robust persona fusing to such a simple state. However, other than the complaints I mentioned, I found the combat overall to be exceptional and constantly engaging. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n\nThe writing in Strikers is incredible. This game got many laughs out of me and made me feel a lot. However, the writing for the more emotional moments can get a bit too on the nose for my liking, a common problem for Persona, unfortunately. The villain(s) were all fantastic in how they went about their way of doing things instead of the one-dimensional cartoonishly evil villains in P5. They\u2019re all fantastic. However, some backstory for some of the villain(s) gets thrown in your face like 20 seconds before fighting them which felt cheap, even if it was effective. The main characters (Ryuji, Ann, Haru, Futaba, etc) all remain the great characters they are, but they see little growth in the main story. I mean it\u2019s there, but not enough in my opinion.\n\nNow to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, I love the inclusion of Zenkichi and Sophia. Sophia is an adorable muffin that sees an unbelievable amount of growth in the story. It\u2019s to the point where I consider Sophia to be one of my favorites in all of the Persona series. Zenkichi was amazing as well with a lovable personality and real growth, although not to the extent of Sophia. But they both remain absolutely incredible inclusions to the series.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nIt\u2019s Persona. What do you think? Of course, it\u2019s incredible. The remixes of P5 music as well as the original music in Strikers are all fantastic. [i]Counter Strike[/i] and [i]Daredevil[/i] being personal favs.\n\nHowever, the audio mixing could use some work. The characters become REALLY difficult to hear during boss fights especially with the music is blaring. This can be remedied by messing with the audio levels in the in-game settings, but I hate that this is even an issue.\n\n[b]PC PORT[/b]\n\nWhat a disappointment. Firstly, the positives. The game runs at a stable 60fps all the time. I only ever saw frame drops during cutscenes and the velvet room of all places. Other than that, the performance is solid.\n\nNow for the negatives. This game LOVES to crash. It mainly ever crashed for me during fast travel or loading screens. During my 60 hour journey, I crashed a total of 7 times. [b]7!!![/b] Sometimes I would lose upwards of an hour of progress. Do you know how much it sucks to bust your balls on a difficult boss only for the game to crash afterward without saving? Next, the game options are poor. The game is capped at 60fps. I don\u2019t know if this is an engine issue or if the devs were too lazy to uncap it or what. Furthermore, the game still looks poor. Not the style, mind you (P5 style is still present here in all its glory), but the game doesn\u2019t look enhanced at all for PC. Textures can be muddy and the UI quality REAKS. WHY IS IT SO PIXILATED?! Overall, a pretty disappointing port. Also, RIP mods.\n\nEDIT 03/17/2021: New update has been pushed today that [i]seems[/i] to have fixed or at least remedied the constant crashing. So that's cool.\n\n[b]Closing thoughts[/b]\n\nOverall, my expectations were blown away by this game. I was expecting a mindless button masher that would give me some kicks based purely on seeing my favorite characters get back together. It is so much more than that. It\u2019s got its issues, sure. It\u2019s not perfect and some things really drag the game down. However, it does so much right at the same time. This isn\u2019t just a spinoff, it\u2019s the true Persona 5 sequel.",

        "content": "I really enjoy the Persona series so when this game was first introduced, I was already intrigued by it.\n\nThe game's story revolves around the life AFTER the original Persona 5 game, so if you haven't played it and care about the story, I would not recommend you to play this game first.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's decent. It's a hack-and-slash after all and all you are doing is just hitting random buttons and kill every enemy that is in your line of sight. Some fights will require you to use skills more carefully, such as bosses and dire shadows, but those aren't really that difficult as well, even on Hard difficulty.\n\nStory-wise, it's standard. It follows the same story/plot of Persona 5 so nothing has really changed much in this game.\n\nI only have 5 hours in this game and only just completed story 1. Game is really enjoyable so far and I will be sure to complete the game!",

        "content": "If you love Persona series but don't like Dynasty Warriors's combat system template. I am glad to say it's far more than that. Sure, there are still mindless waves of fodders for you to smash them away, but they also implement tactical RPG stuff really nicely. You will find yourself planning the fight surprisingly a lot more than that. Most systems from Persona series are coming back and fit in really nicely (Elemental weakness, One-more, All-out-attack, Showtime.) It feels not out of place and keep it very true to the lore of Persona 5 in every aspect from gameplay, design, theme, and world's logic.\n\nOne thing that can be see as a downside is P5S is the direct continuation of Persona 5 (with some references to P5R too.) And it's not a small side story but pretty much a full fledged saga. They do try to rush out some of quick recap in the first hour but people without experience of  Persona 5 can find this sudden insertion to technical stuff too absurd for them. Is it needed? Not really. But your reaction would be \"Oh! I remember that! Nice!\" every thirty seconds to \"WTF just happened?\" based on your exposure to Persona franchise. Still a great game, but ATLUS and SEGA should really considered boosting this game with the Persona 5 Royal release on PC.",

But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker! Such a pity he was busy buying cabbage so he couldn't make it to this game [/spoiler]",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is probably the best \"Warriors\" game ever made.\n---\nYou play as Joker, a person with the Wild Card ability, which is a pass for using multiple Personas in the franchise. You and Morgana returned to Tokyo for your summer vacation, after planning for a barbecue with your friends, you were suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more...\n---\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nThe combat is a combination of both Warriors-series by Omega Force and Persona-series, although it's a lot more similar to \"Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon\", with the fluidity and mobility of \"Warriors\" combat. You'll still primarily press a series of buttons to execute your attacks and strong attacks, however, you can also pause in-combat to use your Persona skills or recovery items.\nEach character, Persona, and enemy have their own kit, strength, and weaknesses. The way abilities are used by enemies will vary for each type of enemy, for example, Mara's \"One-Shot Kill\" would send a barrage of bullets towards the enemy (and 'stains' you for some reason), while Seth's \"One Shot Kill\" would be an explosion. This variation makes for a unique encounter for each enemy. You can obtain Personas by defeating them in the battlefield, or by fusing two (or more) Personas in the Velvet Room.\nThe hack-and-slash gameplay is vastly different than in other Warriors games. Each enemy will also have a \"Knockdown Gauge\" which, if depleted, will knock them down and enables \"1 More\" move and/or \"All-Out Attack\" for the player. You can deplete the gauge by dealing critical hits or striking the enemies' weaknesses. If the enemy still has \"Knockdown Gauge\", they won't stagger at all by your normal attacks, which lets them to counter your attacks by using abilities.\nYou can play as one of four characters that you choose before delving into a dungeon. Each character is actually fun to play, and each of them has certain characteristics in their movesets which are unique to them, which makes for a fun, different playstyle for each character -- something that is missing from modern Warriors games.\n-----\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAh, the story. Before the story starts, there was an phenomenon called the \"Change of Hearts\" epidemic in which some high-profile figures confessed to many scandals, the authorities ruled out the possibility that the Phantom Thieves are the perpetrator behind this phenomenon and started an investigation against them.\nBack to Joker and friends. After planning for a barbecue, they downloaded an app called EMMA, an artificial intelligence guide, which also doubles as an SNS app in which users can become friends with each other by sharing their \"keywords\". Turns out, some keywords will send people's Shadows to Jails within the Metaverse. With the Metaverse's return, Joker and the Phantom Thieves set out to solve the mystery behind it. Along the way, they were informed by a member of the authorities that the same phenomenon is currently happening in Sapporo, and the said member also asked the assistance of the Phantom Thieves to solve the case.\nThe Phantom Thieves decided that they would spend their summer vacation solving the mystery of the Jails and the Metaverse, while also having a road trip across various cities in Japan.\n---\nThe story is a generic slice-of-life anime story with a pinch of \"Shin Megami Tensei\", typical Persona games. The 3D cutscenes and incredible voice acting makes the story interesting enough for me, that I can endure a 40 minute-long series of cutscenes.\nBottom line, the story is pretty good, but the duration of the cutscenes are probably too long for some people.\n-----\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIf you played both Warriors and Persona games, then you'll want to cross Easy and Normal out of your choices. Hard difficulty offers a tough but fair combat, and you'll risk of actually losing the battle.\nAfter you beat the game and beat the ultimate boss, you'll unlock a new difficulty for New Game+ called \"Merciless\". This difficulty will crank enemy status through the roof, even early Shadows like Pixies and Jack o' Lanterns will easily kill you. Hell, the tutorial Bicorn feels like Chaos-Lu Bu where you can be killed in two hits -- even if you're level 82 with high-tier Personas.\nSo yeah, go with Hard mode for the first playthrough, and choose Merciless for the second playthrough. At least you won't be too surprised by the difficulty jump in New Game+.\n-----\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nCrashes. I experienced more than 12 crashes in my first playthrough, it often happens after leaving the Velvet Room, whenever cutscene background changing drastically (for example, from inside LeBlanc to outside LeBlanc), and leaving dungeons. Some even happen in the middle of a series of cutscenes after a 10 minutes boss fight. I really hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n------\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI had fun playing this game, 54 hours of hack-and-slash-plus-JRPG fun accompanied by an interesting and entertaining story -- makes for a game I would easily recommend to anyone. I hope that I can see another Strikers game again from Atlus and Omega Force.\n-----\nThat being said, please port Persona 5 Royal to PC, Atlus.",

        "content": "The unexpected persona game to say the least but ATLUS did a very good job of keeping this game, well... still in the theme of Persona.\n\n[h1] Combat Mechanics [/h1]\nTo be simple, Turn-based JRPG turn Real-Time.\nA lot combat aspects are still there, surprisingly. Exploit weaknesses, All-Out-Attack, Baton Pass.[b] THEY ARE ALL STILL THERE! [/b] I'm surprise of how they are manage to do that and make it work flawlessly. And the most exciting of all, the Showtime is just gorgeous!\n\n[h1] Everyday Mechanics [/h1]\nApart from the cut confidant, not a lot have change. You start by gather the information about the target  and then you go in the dungeon now call \"The Jail\" and then you go to a total nut job mode. Sometime do a request and spend time talking with teammates or inside the RV. Basically the game loop is that.\nBond system is the new one that they introduce in this game. Similar to Social Links/Confidant but instead of going to each teammates and get their abilities, you get points to upgrades which you will need them.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nSince currently at the time of this review I have not finish the game yet and I know that no ones want a spoiler. So the only thing that I'm going to talking about is how they tell the story.\nThe story goes on like in the Persona 5, you notice that something is going on in Shibuya just when the Thieves are having a summer trip and later they know that the issue is going across the japan in various cities. The story has to deal with trauma of \"the Monarch\", the ruler of Jail, that works like a Palace [b]with a twist[/b].\n\n[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]\nTalk about Persona without the music is [b]WRONG[/b].\nAlthough Shoji Meguro, ATLUS house composer, is not the composer in Persona 5 Striker, the music still an absolute banger! Sound effects overall is perfect.\nRight now I really dig \"Welcome To The Jail\", \"Counter Strike\", \"Axe To Grind\", \"You are Stronger\" and a lot more!\n\nTo be honest, the things that ATLUS did. This would be a bottom at my list of what ATLUS would do the their games and I have doubt at first about this being the Beat'em Up kind of game because I don't like this kind of game. But they really take my breath away here, got to give it to them.",

The story feels like a worthy Persona 5 sequel and the gameplay is the perfect mix of action and Persona gameplay. The combat does for Persona what FF7 Remake does for FF7.\n\nThe game is not without it's technical bugs which will hopefully be ironed out. I had multiple crashes and consistent freezes when zoning into one of the dungeons which needed to be waited out to continue. I was more than willing to overlook these issues and power through as the game is just really good and hard to put down.\n\nIf you haven't played Persona 5 However I would recommend holding off on playing this until you have. (Hopefully Persona 5 sees a Steam release at some point. Please Sega) The story does very little to explain what happened in the previous game as it presumes you already know the events. Which is a good and bad things as this doesn't really spoil the story of the original too much if you were to play this first, but might leave Strikers only players confused about what/who is being referenced at times. \n\nThis is a must play for Persona 5 players and for everyone else play both.",

        "content": "TLDR : A Refreshing take on the Persona franchise that actually works pretty well, with a few hiccups here and there. A solid game despite the lack of it's predecessor, P5 being on Steam (GIVE US P5R ON PC ATLUS / SEGA!) \n\nFull Review :\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes the traditional turn based combat gameplay of Persona and actually manages to make a pretty good hack'n'slash adaptation of it. Persona skills and all work well within a real-time environment, and you even have the ability to string them into combos for no SP cost too (SP is basically the \"mana\" of Persona, for the newcomers). \n\nThe game does have one major flaw though in it's execution, the lack of the social aspect of Persona. In the mainline Modern Persona games (Persona 3 FES / P3 Portable / Persona 4 Golden (it's on Steam too go buy it) / Persona 5 / P5R) you have a big focus on the social side of gameplay, interacting with your companions, potential romance options, etc., which tie into the dungeon crawling aspect of them by strengthening companions you have strong bonds too. None of that is present in Strikers here, which is a shame. \n\nStrikers is also much more linear than the mainline games. That's not to say the mainline games I'm comparing it too had multiple endings or anything (P4 had like 7, P5R had 4 or so if I remember right), but they had a TON of stuff mixed into the social side, such as choosing whether to go out with friends (strengthen bonds) or do something to strengthen your own stats on a specific day. Speaking of days, in Strikers there isn't any time progression outside of story events, so unlike in the main games, there's nothing really pressuring you to pick and choose things, so you can basically just sit and grind if you want, which, admittedly works well for Strikers gameplay wise, but still worth noting the difference there. \n\nThe game also lacks a lot of the Personas from 3-5 too, there's a lot, don't get me wrong, just MUCH more in the main games, though I'm not counting it as a negative thing, still plenty to choose from and you can easily use the Persona Points system (unique to Strikers, not in earlier games) and the accumulated power system to strengthen your favorite Personas. That plus the fusion system which is a Persona mainstay allow for you to easily take that level 5 weak Persona and turn him into a 99-Stat monster. \n\nThe dungeons are also different here as well, they're much more open than the ones in Persona 3, 4 and 5, while keeping the similar style that dungeons in Persona 5 had. This is mostly due to the combat being you and the Phantom Thieves against a horde of shadows every time, but it works. \n\nOverall it's pretty great. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal (or the base Persona 5) you may be somewhat lost with the terms and world of the game, but outside of the story of the Phantom Thieves and the Metaverse, you can still have a good time and know the basics. The story isn't as good as the mainline games either, likely due to it being shorter and more condensed (40 hours in Strikers vs. 100 hours in Persona 4 Golden or 150 in P5 Royal). \n\nAlso, if you're wondering about the DLC under the game, ignore the All Out Attack Pack, but definitely go and buy the legacy BGM pack, as it includes battle themes from every mainline Persona games, even the old 1990s Persona 1 and 2 that nobody remembers. It also includes the very popular themes from P3, P3P, P4, and P4G, that is to say\n\n- A Lone Prayer (Persona 1)\n-Mass Destruction (Persona 3)\n-Wiping All Out (Persona 3 Portable, from the Female Main Character's Route in that game)\n- Reach out To the Truth (Persona 4)\n- Time to Make History (Persona 4 Golden) \n\nYou actually also get the themes from Persona 5  and Persona 5 Royal IN THE BASE GAME WITHOUT DLC, you just have to beat the main story and get a game cleared save file to get access to them, but the base game does come with a pretty awesome rock remix of Last Surprise (P5's theme) in the base game before then, it's pretty neat. \n\nI'd like to end this review by engaging in the time honored tradition of port-begging\n*ahem*\n\nPLEASE ATLUS / SEGA GIVE US PERSONA 3 FES and PERSONA 5 ROYAL!\n\nThank you for reading this review and I hope it helped.",

        "content": "This isn't the first game collaborating with Omega Force to make a Musou/Dynasty Warriors spin-off from another IP, but it's probably the most unique. It makes you feel like playing a hack-and-slash warriors game with all the action RPG flare in it, but also a Persona/Shin Megami Tensei game with world map exploration and tactical battles. It's not a war game but an expanded take on Atlus' formula that feels the best of both worlds.\n\nThe story: Six months after the Phantom Thieves' greatest heist, the team gets back together for summer vacation. They get help to prepare from a super AI phone app known as EMMA, which supposedly can know all about user preferences and what you want/need to shop and where. But during a routine shopping trip and a run-in with an overly popular idol, Joker, Mona and Skull find themselves suddenly thrown into the Metaverse once more. As they escape, they discover an odd girl who introduces herself as Sophie, humanity's companion, who quickly lends their aid to the thieves. The team decides to cut vacation plans short as they get to the bottom of this situation, but things are worse than they appear. Inspector Zenkichi from Public Security warns the thieves that there are similar problems happening all over the country, and that Joker's the number one suspect of all the \"changed hearts\" happening. Not only must they clear their name, but prepare for another ominous calamity on the horizon.\n\nStrikers is mostly for Persona 5 fans though as it'll jump in expecting you to mostly know what happened in the previous game (and that's vanilla form; no mention of \"Kasumi\" from Royale here). They do bring up references from the prequel whenever it feels necessary, whether it's to explain the new \"Jails\" work or bringing their newest member Sophie up to speed. There's even a clever interface where first registering EMMA you can put in the main protagonist (Joker)'s real name, as well as setting up other game options from voice overs to difficulty.\n\nIt definitely feels like a sequel and not that out of place from the previous entry. Unlike other Persona spin-offs that while having fun premises were very jarring and different from turn-based gameplay. A musou action RPG feels a more organic take-off than say, a 2-D fighter (Persona 4 Arena) or rhythm game (Dancing All Night, Dancing in Starlight, Dancing in Moonlight). It also feels more of a continuation to the story than fanservice for fanservices' sake, like with Arena or Q-Q2.\n\nBack to gameplay, you have your options to attack with a melee weapon, shoot with a gun, or use a Persona spell for advantages. What's new is that you can also access a \"special\" command, which is kind of rudimentary in musou games like this. If the melee attack is your light attack, then the special is your heavy, and using any combination of these buttons can string combos for better results than just mashing attack over and over. In some cases, the combos allow you to use a Persona's elemental attack without using up SP and striking their weaknesses for extra damage. Every character plays different and feel more than just gated by their stats and elements. For example, Joker is nimble and balanced with his attacks flowing very quickly and his specials having the potential to change up based on what Persona he equips.\n\nJoker is the only character who can collect and use different Personas that you face in the game as Shadows, which is benefited by entering the Velvet Room. Compared to examples in the original games, the Velvet Room feels more user friendly in that you don't have to worry about confidant links to power up through levels; you can power level them yourself and consistently as you collect Power Points from mask drops. You can even increase the level of your starter Persona, Arsene. Unlike most other Personas you collect, he gets new skills that scale up as he gets stronger. However, each level up costs significantly more points, and Persona level ups have fixed stats instead of 3 at random. Some increase all across the board (Strength, Endurance, Agility, Magic, Luck), some don't increase at all. Leveling Personas up makes transferring skills when you fuse feel easier, and instead of a complicated math program that determines what arcana/level between personas, they have predetermined fusions. On the plus side, when you resummon Personas to use, they stay the same and the cost doesn't scale up from their level, no matter how many times you register (save) their levels and spell list in the compendium. \n\nThe game is very linear, and there's no rush to clear things in time unlike the prequel. You sadly won't see much of the supporting cast (Takemi and Iwai had their stores closed for the summer, for example, forcing you to rely on Sophie for shopping needs). But that means you won't suffer many time crunching consequences regardless of difficulty. You can buy all the items at vending machines/stores in the hub world, travel through a Jail for hours at end, grinding for money and treasure, then leave. The stores will restock to buy again, and the characters HP/SP will have restored to max reflecting their new earned levels. Time will move forward when you progress with the story, usually by accomplishing an intel task or fighting a checkpoint boss. You are free to take your time in the game, no worries. \n\nSound is finicky at parts, as I swear I feel the mic for Ryuji/Skull's lines trail off as he mumbles his script. Music is mostly recycled from the previous game (or games if you got the digital bundle and get the option to change what battle music plays from across the Persona series). There seem to be only a few new songs, being Jail and overmap related. There are also remixes such as \"Blooming Villain\" that sound like a fitting theme for Lu Bu were he in this game. The character models look as great as they did in the prequel, and while there might be some off putting textures to some, I didn't notice a problem. Maybe it's because PC is running better than PS4 or Switch these days.\n\nIn the end, Persona 5 Strikers is a very solid game. If you like Musou Action RPGs with a limited but strong roaster of character to play through, this is one you should pick up. If you love Persona 5 and want to see more of the gang that steal hearts nationwide, then you should REALLY pick up this game.",

        "content": "If you played and enjoyed Persona 5, this is a must play. ATLUS and KT Games succeed in mixing the Dynasty warriors gameplay of their games with the quality of worldbuilding, strong characters, good writing and sharp art design of Persona 5.\nThe Gameplay is action heavy and not too complex but still somehow engaging and nice to look at.\nThe game completely lacks the life sim of Persona and makes the time of the game play out as you complete specific story events. You can expect dynasty warriors gameplay but with a Persona Twist as you are able to stop time and attack your opponent(s) with a wide variety of physical and magic moves, that have different types, just like in a Pokemon Game. This adds a leven of complexity to the gameplay and preparation (SP).\nThe Game features FANTASTIC MUSIC both new and from the Persona 5 game. Also it features the good UX design from P5.\nThe game runs well on my 3070 at 4k60 max settings and my friends report a good experience even on dated Hardware like the 1060, you can expect 1080p60 max settings with a solid bit of overhead here.\nThe only thing that is a bit of a mixed bag is the difficulty, there are some spikes that could have been balanced better, and the UX during fights. (sometimes there is just tooo much happening on screen to see what your character is doing)\nIf you didn't play Persona 5: THIS GAME CONTAINS SPOILERS for that game and the Story does not properly explain the core concepts of Persona, that you need in order to understand everything well!!\nAll in all Persona5 Scramble: The phantom Strikers is a good game, that hase some flaws but is a mostly enjoyable experience.\nYou schould absolutely play it if:\n- You played and enjoyed Persona 5 and you desperately want to immerse yourself in that world again.\n- You like Dynasty Warriors Gameplay and have a solid idea of what Persona is all about\nYopu should avoid it if:\n- You are looking for a straight up Persona 5 sequel with life sim and all, this game is not that\n- you want ultra deep and complex Gameplay that is easy to learn, hard to master\n- You have never played a Persona Game or don't know what persona even is\n\nFor me PERSONALLY tha game is a 7/10\n",

I played P5 on the PS4 and dont remember it looking so good. Unfortunately the game doesnt support ultrawide monitors or frame rates above 60 fps. Bummer. Also why did I have to buy the deluxe edition to play 4 days earlier? If it werent my birthday I wouldve waited and saved $10.\n\nEdit: For whatever reason the game drops to 30fps. It was a stable 60fps when I first launched it. Until this problem gets fixed I'm not going to recommend. Get rid of denuvo too. Only hurts my performance.",

This game's twist is basically that it turns the traditional turn based Persona system into a stylish and dynamic real-time RPG with some hack-n-slash elements. Also this game is definitely quite easy until the ending where it gets somewhat challenging so I recommend to play on Hard which honestly feels kind of easy for someone new to the genre. Another gripe is that the game right now as a crashing issue and I see other people are experiencing it too - personally I have crashed like 7-8 times during my gameplay (usually when fast-travelling) so I HIGHLY recommend saving whenever you can until this issue is resolved. If you can look past these flaws, The story is solid, you'll get your values worth with ~40 hours of content, and the game is legitimately fun and addicting. \n\n8/10",

It's always my jam!\n-I'm really liking the new characters so far!

(My picks so far: Joker, Skull, and Noir)\nEach having a different attack style and special attacks. [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] \u2022Combat is different from P5/R, yet follows the same rules of stats (like ice being weak to fire, etc.) [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] \u2666Bonds are a new addition, similar to the Confidant Stats in P5R, yet more options to choose from that'll help you in combat. Can be somewhat overwhelming at first, but is very nice when use to it. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I love Persona 5 and Persona as a whole, and this makes a great addition!\nEven only being 7 hours into it, it's well worth the wait!!

It takes a spin bringing main elements from musou games and combining it with persona. However if you're familiar with Persona 5, you can form bonds with individual characters and form special relationships. But, the confidant system is different and not as full fledged. So you can't romance up any characters sadly, would've loved to romance Sophie for the laughs. Fusing Personas are ultimately the same as in p5. The dialogue and character building is as expected of a persona game, pretty darn good. The monarchs, which are the villains who control a jail, each have tragedy in their past that led them to do wrong which makes the player not view them as pure evil but actual human beings. Honestly, this is such a 'lax and fun take on the p5 franchise, recommend it all the way.",

Once Phantom Thieves, now your IRL money thieves, avoid like plague until major issues are 100% resolved.\n",

        "content": "The closest thing we'll get from Persona 5 on PC until Atlus ports the thing itself or (preferably) the Royal remake.\n\nOverall, the game is great. It is basically Persona 5-2, but with a complete change in gameplay. If you enjoyed the original game, this title is a must. I'd say this is an almost perfect adaptation from the turn-based style to a hack-and-slash type of game, keeping the same Shadows weaknesses, strengths and spells.\n\nHowever, it has its flaws. By the time I'm writing this review the game kept crashing randomly, either while loading a new in-game rendered cutscene (which can make you lose quite a bit of progress in the first dungeons) or when entering a Jail. The Anti-Aliasing messes with the text a bit (not something that makes the game unplayable, but it feels a bit weird). \n\nThe Keyboard and Mouse Button Configuration is also severely lacking. It's not as bad as only having preset controls like Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, but anything to the right of \"Enter\" is unbindable, which means anyone who uses the Arrow Keys will have a really hard time playing unless they have a controller.\n\nBut still, the game is awesome and well worth of being a sequel to Persona 5.",

Persona 3 and 5 are some of my favorite games ever and it kind of baffles my mind how much worse the story and characters are when compared to how they were in original P5 and Royal. The game is fun sometimes, the dialogue is good sometimes, the music is good sometimes. Always just sometimes good. Honestly I remember about 3 or 4 songs from the soundtrack which is baffling to me because if you played the entire 181 tracks from original Persona 5 I could probably name 85%-90% of them. The gameplay is fun... until you hit a certain point and it just gets so insanely stale. You never have to care about fusing cool personas because it's a cakewalk with a single good boss. The characters are shadows of their original personalities. Honestly the only thing this game has over original persona 5 is some better humor. I really don't know why I'm giving this a positive review lol I felt so incredibly numb.",

There are a few (indirect) spoilers for it's prequel. Additionally, the gameplay (while good) doesn't give you a good idea for how a regular Megami Tensei game plays.\n\nIf your new to the series, I'd recommend you play Persona 4 Golden on Steam or just wait for the (very likely) announcement of a Persona 5 Royal / Shin Megami Tensei: III Nocturne HD Remaster port.\n\nThe port seems alright overall: settings are barebones but performance is good. The anti aliasing setting is subpar, it's a very basic on or off feature, and the game looks very jaggy regardless if the setting is on or off. Resolution scaling doesn't change until you alt + tab in and out of the game. The game runs really good and without frame drops (that I could notice anyway, and I'm using a GPU that was considered mid range 5 years ago).\n\nI will update with an in depth review after I've finished the game.",

However, this is a sequel to P5, and pretty much requires that you have played the original game. Hopefully P5 or P5R will be ported to PC sometime in the near future so more people can get full enjoyment out of this game.",

Instead, come into it expecting a summer vacation with a bunch of your pals. It's a much more lighthearted story that makes you spend more time with the Phantom Thieves all around Japan.\n\nSpeaking of going around Japan, HOLY COW THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD TO BUY AND MAKE. IT'S HONESTLY THE BEST THING EVER. It feels like a real vacation to go from place to place. It's so refreshing, and it's a whole lot of fun finding out what's the next location.\n\nAbsolutely not as good as the mainline entries, but this spin-off is absolutely worth your time if you enjoyed 5 or Royal.",

The writing is on par with the original and Royal, and while this game is more of a \"fan service-y\" type deal, Atlus made sure to not forget about what made Persona 5 great in the first place, creating a fun road trip adventure that didn't need to be told, but I'm glad it was. Seeing the thieves older and wiser while also keeping their charm and traits from the original mad me smile, and allowed me to truly see just how much these characters have grown. \n\nThe Musou style combat mixed in with Persona turn based elements came together perfectly, and while the camera can be a but weird sometimes, the combat always remained fluid and fun and never got boring even until the very end of the game. Persona fusion also makes a return, and while I have my quarrels with the new PP system, Persona Fusion is still crazy fun to do, allowing the player to create some incredibly OP Persona's that just shred enemies to a fine shadow-y paste. \n\nI became a huge Persona fan after playing Royal back in August. I never really was a JRPG guy, but for some reason Persona 5 always peaked my interest, and when I finally played it I fell in love. The Phantom Thieves are probably my favorite cast of video game characters period, and after 6 months of playing through the entire franchise, I was incredibly happy to be with the thieves on another adventure. I just hope this isn't their last.",

        "content": "FIRST OF ALL A WARNING:\n[b]DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED PERSONA 5 ALREADY AND ARE STILL PLANNING TO AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE! THIS GAME NOT ONLY CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, BUT ALSO BUILDS DIRECTLY ON THE PLOT OF P5 AND HEAVILY REFERENCES IT![/b]\n\nWith that out of the way, here's what a Persona Veteran and someone who's played through both P5 *and* P5R twice respectively, thinks of P5S so far:\n\nBiggest and most obvious change compared to the main series game is the combat system; instead of using the incredibly perfect turn-based combat approach from the main series, Strikers instead uses a realtime buttonmashing/Dynasty Warriors-ish kind of approach.\n\nWhen I first heard that, I was pretty disappointed, because Persona and turn-based just go hand in hand, and for very good reason.\n\nAfter having played it for myself, the first two hours or so I was still pretty on the fence, because it really was mostly button-mashing, and as I expected, the camera is a major hassle unless you lock on to a single enemy within a crowd of dozens.\n\nThe good news however is that it does get somewhat better over time, i.e. with story progress; you'll get environmental interactables that allow for special attacks, ranging from dashing onto a  lamp post to slide down with a wild spin-kicking tornado attack, to jumping on skateboards and just mowing down entire platoons of enemies, or even using stuff like oversized party poppers to bombard them from a distance.\nSo what the combat system lacks in tactical depth and detailed strategic combat gameplay, it reasonably makes up for in crazy and fun blowing-off-steam kind of combat escapades.\n\nAs for the story, it stays true to what we've seen in Persona 5, being a very well-written narrative with deeply emotional moments, philosophical questions, plot twists, as well as an overall theme that carries through 'til the end.\n\nI won't go into further details for obvious spoiler reasons, but suffice it to say that if you've loved P5's story, then'll you'll probably love P5:S's just the same, especially since the characters themselves reference a lot of the main storyline's key moments, and reminisce about the nostalgia of it all at pretty much the same time as you, the player, get that very same nostalgic feeling about encountering the main cast again.\n\nThe new members of the Phantom Thieves are also very intriguing and very well written (though one more so than the other, in my opinion), so look forward to discovering just what these two wil become over the course of the 25 - 35 hours of playtime.\nAll in all, this really feels much more like an addon to P5, story-wise, if not gameplay-wise, rather than \"just\" a spin-off.\n\nThere is some bad news too, however, namely in the [b]total lack of social/time management gameplay[/b] that is so typical of the Persona main series games.\nStrikers, sadly, is 100% linear, and fully scripted ... there's only one singular instance in the entire game where you can actually choose with whom to go on a ferris wheel ride, and that's it.\nNo romance, no confidants, nothing.\n\nThe same, equally sadly, goes for the Requests; compared to Persona 5 proper, in Strikers they are really, really uninspired, with 90+ percent consisting of generic fetch quests, or equally generic \"Kill X of Y in Z\" quests.\n\nAs I said (yelled from the rooftops :P) in the beginning, in my opinion, this game should only be played if you've already played through Persona 5 on console.\n\nIf you haven't yet, much of this game won't make much sense to you... you won't get any of the \"en passant\"-references, you won't really understand the major story references in highly emotional moments, and you don't even know the main cast at all, since Strikers doesn't bother to (re-)introduce them, instead expecting you to already know who they are, what they went through, how they became Phantom Thieves... you'd basically get thrown into a road trip of a group of extremely tight-knit friends whom you've never seen before in your life.\n\nAnd, again, the most important warning goes out to those of you who are still planning to play P5 eventually, maybe waiting for a potential PC release, or until they can afford console or game, or whatever:\n\n[b]Do _not_ play P5:S beforehand, it _will_ ruin large parts of the Persona 5 story and experience for you![/b]",

P5S also brings back all the familiar characters which means the game can essentially skip the playable character exposition and just jump straight into story from the get-go which is well written just as its predecessor was. Combine that with another fantastic soundtrack and you've got another amazing game.",

It's very fun to see this game take place in an action Musou format rather than an RPG. It kind of adds to the immersion in a way. Super charming to see the gang back together stealing twisted desires. Something I appreciate about this game is that it's not *just* a Warriors game, but it really feels like a bite sized Persona game with the life sim mechanics. Persona on PC in general is eye candy and super convenient to just boot up since I'm usually using my computer every day.",

I decided to give it a second chance and bought just a game. And what do i see? Technically, P5S have launched is even WORSE, than P4G. What the hell is that, Atlus? An HOUR of endless blackscreen after an animetel Phantom Thieves loading-logo and a note that i don't have any save files. And my PC have succesefully launched Code Vein, i could play smoothly. I suppose, it's because of the opening. You again repeat same mistaces, as you did with P4G. I won't change this review until you patch the game. Because i *want* to play your Persona games, but i didn't pay for a piece of piss that doesn't work properly.\n\nUPD: I've managed to fix blackscreen and get 60fps, but only with the cost cutscenes. So.... Yeah! It's just like the launch of P4G with shuttering cutscenes and constant softlock that won't allow you to play the game AT ALL this time. In P4G, at least, they were with a slight chance and while All-Out-Attack. But here - you can't start the game completly [spoiler]after first battle, scene in police departament and reunion of the gang[/spoiler]. You're simply stuck, watching at your grey phone!\n\nWhat prevented you from making exact same mistakes as in P4G? And we should again wait for 3 months?! Please, repear this game as fast as possible. I beg you.",

I have been slowly taking my time exploring and ensuring i don't miss out on things - i really appreciate ability to play as your favourite characters, Sophia was definitely a ultimately cute surprise, but Ryuji has always been my number #1.

Music is fantastic by remixing and adding to the P5 soundtrack, it feels nostalgic but different so it doesn\u2019t get boring from what you listened to for hours in the previous game. Also, new great music that I haven\u2019t listened to much as I get distracted in the fights which come at you like raids than a tactical strategy, but still using some of the features of the old games like guns and personas weaknesses with all-out attacks.\nAnd best of all...

It's got an interesting story with the phantom thieves as you fight evil and go on summer vacation with the gang. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405199046\n\nThe mouse and keyboard controls are pretty decent though playing with a controller is a lot more comfortable. The combat is quite fun with the hack n slash style with the characters having their own unique mechanics, it gives the gameplay a bit more fun as you take down the waves of enemies. The atmosphere of the game is great with the many interesting characters and dialogue to read and listen to with the excellent japanese and english voiceovers. Visuals are nice with well animated anime cutscenes as well as the ingame details. Music of course are also bangers. It is most definitely worth it for those who are a fan of the Persona franchise and Persona 5 in particular. Here's hoping that Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal also comes to steam.\n\nAlso lewds\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405151806",

If you can even call it that...\n\nP5S is a perfect hybrid of what RPG and Musou should look like. \n\nFaithful to the original game, but adding elements from warriors games to make combat fluid while maintaining difficulties and challenges (If you attack enemies without exploiting their weaknesses, prepare to get destroyed). Coupled with banger soundtracks both new and remixed, this is the game I'm more than happy to pre-order and pay full price for!\n\nWould avoid if you've not played Persona 5 as it contain major spoilers but otherwise, this is definitely a strong contender for my GOTY.",

        "content": "Looking cool, Joker!\n\nA really fun sequel to the original Persona 5, continuing the story 6 months after the original game, and mostly keeping up with the standards for story set by its predecessor, albeit retreading many of the same paths, leaving the plot extremely derivative of the original, though making up for that in strides with its characters!\n\nWith an action-based combat system similar to the Dynasty Warrior games, the classic Persona fusing mechanics, and a whole heap of style, the combat is a joy to experience, especially with each Phantom Thief bringing something unique to the table! \nDefinitely feeling a lot more like a Persona game than a Dynasty Warriors one.\n\nAlthough it is a shame that the social sim aspect of the original isn't present in this game, the cast and the story of this game is just as interesting! The story makes sure to show off the bonds the members of the Phantom Thieves have with each other, actually presenting them as a group of friends, something I feel the original was missing, and keeps much of the original presentation. Not quite reaching the same highs as the the original, but good nonetheless, carried almost entirely by its interesting and fun characters.\n\nUnfortunately the game comes with several technical issues. \nDue to the pandemic the English cast had to record their lines from home, and it really shows. While their performances are just as spectacular as in the original Persona 5, the audio quality and mixing is all over the place with certain lines being hardly audible, especially near the very beginning of the game, though it does get better and less noticeable as the game goes on.\nThe game also suffers from terrible aliasing and texture compression that makes it look like the image is built out of Minecraft blocks, and a faulty Anti-Aliasing solution that makes everything look smudged, including the text, which is a real shame because the UI and art of this game ooze style, just like Persona 5! The ability to increase render scaling does help to alleviate some of the issues, so marginally, the image quality can look better than on the PlayStation consoles.\nCoupled with a 60 FPS cap and no analogue movement support, makes this merely an OK port.\n\nThat is, [u][b]if the game works for you at all[/b][/u]. The version available for purchase right now is filled with many issues that directly inhibit your ability to play it. From infinite loading screens and constant crashes to just annoyingly long load times. With these severe issues seemingly being caused by the Denuvo DRM used for the game as the accidentally released DRM-Free version that came out with the Digital Deluxe edition pre-release suffers from none of these.\nAlthough users have found some supposed workarounds, the best way to fix this seems to be to somehow acquire the DRM-Free version of the executable.\n\nIf you are able to overcome the constant crashing and infinite loading times, the rest of these issues are easy to look past though with the fast paced action, charming characters, and the fun times you'll have with the Phantom Thieves in this sequel!\n\n[spoiler] Haru best girl.

        "content": "Considering Persona 5 is my least favorite game out of the persona games i have played, mainly due to a number of reasons like a very lacking and fast-paced story that makes it hard to believe that the phantom thieves are actually close friends because the story moves so fast you barely get any breathing room with the characters, Shido and Akechi both being pretty lacking and boring villains. (Thankfully the villain problem was fixed in Royal), plus a whole bunch of other issues that i wont bother listing now. This doesn't mean i hate Persona 5 however, i quite enjoyed it. just compared to the other games i found it lacking. this meant i didn't really have the highest of hopes going into this. While the problems of the story still going way too fast for my liking is still there i enjoyed that it actually finally felt like the phantom thieves were actual friends and the dynamic they have in this game is miles better than in the original game. The gameplay itself is a little bit rough around the edges and the 2d platforming parts are especially clunky, but besides that the gameplay is solid and fun. also being able to randomly play the battle themes from the previous games is the coolest thing ever, and it can lead to some pretty cool moments with the song matching up with the actions you are doing in the game. Persona 5 Strikers is a worthy sequel to Persona 5 and as someone that found the original lacking in some areas i was surprised by how much i enjoy Strikers.",

Fundamentally, modern Persona is defined by its balance between the RPG dungeon crawling and the life sim, tying them together with a calendar. This game removes the time constraints, making the calendar mere decoration. Moreover, social links/confidants are replaced with the Bond system, giving players access to a variety of perks of their choosing. The fusion system itself has also been greatly simplified. With all of this in mind, it seems as though this game throws out everything that made its predecessors special. However, this game gains more focus on narrative as a result of this. Many fun character interactions stem from this focus and smaller cast. It allows the game to take a form all its own, rather than being more of the same. And all the more, the battles still feel very Persona-esque thanks to ailments, follow-ups, baton passes, weakness, technicals, All-Out Attacks, Persona-switching, and more. I can't recommend this if you don't like action games. But if you even have a minor interest and you played the original/Royal Persona 5, then I heavily recommend this game. Also, the baton pass is literally a high five button now and I love it.",

Social links and time management aren't represented here. But we've got dungeons and lengthy story sequences. The different locations can also be explored to purchase new recipes or talk with your teammates. Sometimes they have special items to give you. Strikers has a similar flow to that of Persona 5 and tells a story that isn't completely unlike that one. It's just different enough, though, and it has the same great writing. \n\nI was worried that the dialogue and plot would feel subpar since this is a spinoff and didn't have the series' main director in charge. But that isn't the case. Strikers looks and feels just like Persona 5 did. The combat is great too. You've got your Warriors charge attacks, except the Phantom Thieves moves all tie in with their Personas. Most of their C3s use the strongest version of their elemental attack, which you can hit enemies with. Once hit with this attack, enemies become vulnerable to a One More attack or All-out Attack. It works a hell of a lot like Persona. You can also summon your Persona, which stops time and lets you think things through. The character's skill lists are the same as you remember them too. If you want to focus on buffs and debuffs while shooting off afflictions, that's something you can do.\n\nIt's pretty much exactly what it should be. It's not as long as Persona 5 by any stretch of the mind, but it's still a lengthy game. If you try and do all of the requests and keep going after beating the game, then you can easily put over 40 hours into it. This is a solid port too, even if the anti-aliasing isn't all that great. It does crash occasionally as well, but it's certainly not common. The only thing I didn't like much was how dumbed down fusing Personas in the Velvet Room is. You can't pick two Personas and combine them anymore. You have to pretty much fuse by result with a minimum level and it's not as enjoyable as the mainline games for that reason. Regardless, this is a remarkable game that any Persona fan will likely enjoy.",

        "content": "A solid addition to the persona series. The story continues from where Persona 5 left off so makes it easy to jump straight in if you've played through the previous. However this also would cause issues with players that have not played through 5 as strikers does not do a good job of explaining characters or events too well. Gameplay wise its a fun mixture of the persona series mechanics (spells and using/collecting different personas) and some Dynasty Warriors hack/slashyness. Sophia is a likeable new addition to the roaster too. \nOverall i would give the game so far a 7/10 with high possibility to increase.",

        "content": "First of all, this game is a sequel of Persona 5. Since Persona 5 is a complete game of its own, there are no major plot points that you need to know to play the game. However, you need to know the major characters from Persona 5 to be able to enjoy Persona 5 Strikers. If you have not watched or played Persona 5, please at least read the wiki pages on all the playable characters.\n\nSecond, the combat changes drastically from Persona 5 (turn-based RPG) to hack-and-slash (specifically Warrior/Musou style aka the Omega-Force style). Check out the gameplay video if you don't know what this means. Most other major Persona gameplay mechanics remain the same (protag wild card personas, level up, etc).\n\nIf you've read up to here and you're okay with everything I've said so far, this is THE GAME for you. \n\nThis game is basically everything you love about Persona 5 on steroid. This game sets during the Summer right after Persona 5 ended. You'd get to see how characters you loved from Persona 5 grow, how they use what they've learned to help people as the Phantom Thieves. One thing that I think Persona 4 did better than Persona 5 is the character development, but Persona 5 Strikers easily outrank Persona 4 on this front (partially because all characters are available and interacting since the beginning of the game).",

The combat is very, VERY good, and actually kinda addicting. In some cases, it rivals the turn-based combat). And the palaces (in this game, they're called jails) are outstanding and just as good as the palaces back in Persona 5.\n\nIf you want the other Persona games to come to PC, buy this.",

No performance problems, no complaints outside of a 60FPS cap. That is a bummer but not world-ending. That being said, the KB+M control scheme is madness. I have no idea how you use it. I recommend using a controller.\n\nI've finished the first jail (think palace) in about six and a half hours. \n\nIn summary, Haru best girl.",

Looking forward to P5R release maybe sometime in the future as well as P6 and P3 remakes on PC. A man can hope",

It's a shame it doesn't include references or callbacks to Royal, but that's okay. \n\nThe UI is a bit too large, but you get used to it quickly. \n\nThe combat feels pretty good overall, but early on it's quite difficult, even on normal difficulty. \nYou can and probably will die almost instantly. \nIf you happen to get trapped in between a Shadow and a wall or hit with a debuff in the early areas of the game you'll most likely lose that character until the fight is over. It's honestly quite punishing and a bit frustrating at times. \n\nOnce you level up a bit and start getting bond skills to increase your health and MP it gets somewhat easier but it always seems like enemies hit a lot harder than you're expecting until you're several levels higher than they are.\n\nMaybe save the \"Hard\" difficulty playthrough for NG+.\n\nVoice acting, soundtrack, and sound design are all great. \nAll the playable characters feel unique and are very fun to use.\nOverall a very solid musou style game. Glad I purchased it. \n\nYou technically don't need to play Persona 5/Royal to understand this story, but they reference it enough where it will severely detract from the experience if you haven't played at least one of those games. \n\nThat being said; Atlus PLEASE port Persona 5 Royal to Steam, I'm glad we at least get the sequel but it feels wrong to not have the previous installment yet.

Note that this is a sequel to 5, not Royal, so characters like Kasumi, and Maruki won't be in here. The story so far is great, but I did notice that there are moments where we get explained concepts that we already know, so I guess if you haven't played Persona 5 or Royal you could jump in, but you would be spoiled character outcomes and stuff like that. I expected the story to be less quality since it isn't as long as 5, but it's actually great. I'm invested into the story an the characters once again. The game runs great on PC, and it looks very nice (I played P5 on the PS3 so that's why it looks so good to me). There is original music, and there are remixes. The music is great. Nitpicks are that anti aliasing is noticeable and I would play with a controller. I have never played a Warriors game, and my friends that have tell me that it gets boring at some point. For me, its my first time so I'm having a lot of fun. I like the mix between Persona and Warriors. One mores, all outs, technicals, they all return. I've played about 25 hours, and I'm having a lot of fun. Definite recommend. If you pick it up, enjoy!",

        "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\nPersona 5 x Warriors series seems like an idea that shouldn't work but somehow it pulls it off amazingly\n\nThere have been multiple times I've genuinely forgot that this was not actually a regular persona game, running about the city talking to everyone, the interactions between characters, the cutscenes and music all just felt so natural. Even the combat itself doesn't feel out of place and seamlessly flows in and out whenever fights start.\n\nThis game has all the elements of persona 5 woven into it in an interesting way, things like baton passes, follow up attacks, persona fusing and all out attacks are still here but made to fit the hack and slash gameplay of a warriors game.\nThe difficulty is actually decent for one of these type games too, usually you just mindlessly mash buttons and feel good taking out thousands at a time but here there are fewer enemies on screen and a harder fight overall, the bosses themselves are also unique and are much more challenging than anything found in its similar titles.\n\nThe music to this game shattered my expectations, I assumed it would be good already seeing as both of the franchises have amazing music already but they really outdid themselves. I got the legacy music pack expecting to flick to that but so far i haven't even wanted to incase i missed out on any of the incredible new tracks.\n\nThe DLC for this game in terms of items is definitely skippable, it honestly doesn't do much at all and so far I haven't used any of it myself. The persona level up points may come in handy eventually but the skills haven't really been necessary, they already give you tons and if you have played a persona game before then you already know how to fuse your way to victory.\n\nThe story takes place after regular Persona 5 and not Royal. As such some players of the newer version may notice differences in character portraits or persona passives in fusing. The new character from royal also doesn't make an appearance but there are plenty more new faces added regardless\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the game looks similar to the ps3 version of P5 and the text is a little off putting at first. I eventually got used to it but I wish there were options to make it look a bit smoother. Other than that it runs fine during gameplay with the occasional crash which can be annoying though it throws so many opportunities to save at you that the most progress I lost was 1 cutscene that i skipped upon reloading anyway.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the most amount of effort of any Koei-Tecmo mainline or spin-off game and even people who don't like their usual stuff should give this one a shot. If you are a fan of persona 5 then you really don't want to miss out on this.",

The game is a direct continuation of Persona 5, and assumes you have already played Persona 5. Events that happened in Persona 5 and essential character backstory are frequently referenced in this game. It honestly baffles me that Persona 5 is not on PC, given that it is basically a requirement to play this game",

Unfortunately, the game's handling of SP results in tedious exiting and reentering the metaverse. The original game expected you to return to reality after running out, but here, exiting doesnt move the calendar, and there's nothing else to do but to keep going, so you are contsantly backtracking to checkpoints and reentering.

        "content": "I'm actually very, very surprised. So, a little thing about me, Persona 5 is my favorite game, of all the one's ive played, and i've played it through several times and royal the same. So when i hear about a spin off of my favorite game, i'm not only skeptical, but i feel like i had a higher expectation for this game than other games. This is a very promising game, as of current i'm only on the second (To not spoil) \"Part\". It's not just a Dynasty warrior style game with a shiny persona coat of paint on it, as it presents more of a different style and challenge than the normal copy pasted format.\n\nThe story is on par with any other persona style story: Very engaging, very in depth, and full of small fun ventures of the phantom thieves in their everyday lives as teenagers. The thing that surprised me was the game play itself. It's not just a copy or direct version of a \"Warriors\" style of game, but offers more of a twist on the combat. With the resistances of not just the larger personas, or the \"Generals\" in the other warrior games, but even all of the small fry shadows that liter the battlefield. You have to be mindful of all the resistances, all the weaknesses, and all of your parties SP and HP gauges, allowing there to be a higher skill ceiling for you to pull off some sweet ass combos. \n\nI also really enjoy that the game is difficult, it's not just \"Smash square to kill all the enemies\" like other warriors games, but it really makes you wary of all the enemies at the same time, and makes you use some brainpower to play. There are only three difficulties (Maybe more later or once i finish the game) But the game is definitely more of a challenge than i was expecting.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game. Maybe i'll update this review later once i beat the game, but for having a 14 hour save and only on the second part, i'm looking forward to how much content there is in the game, and how much more fun i will have with this game. If you like Warriors style games, this is an easy grab, just expect it to be harder than usual. If you're a persona fan, it's got all your favorite characters, plus some new ones (Especially one super adorable character), and it currently has the persona style story. I'm a fan Atlus, you did it for me.",

Although in this game it changes from a turn-based gameplay into an ARPG format, it doesn't mean that you can simply turn your brain off and monkey brain button mash your way through the levels (unlike the Dynasty Warriors franchise). You'll still need to acquire \"some strategy\" in order to not get completely rekt as you progress though the story. The game honestly feels more like a Persona 5 game with ARPG mechanics  rather than another Dynasty Warriors game. Plus, prior knowledge from playing Persona games in general (persona weaknesses, all-out attacks, etc) just adds to the level of expertise that you'll gain from playing this game.",

I get that typical persona feel I got when playing the the base game. I do think that it is a steep price but i have no idea how long the game is so it might be worth the price but i will say it is worth the money but opting to wait for a sale might be the better idea in this case.\n\nIf i were to give a rating on this i would give it a 75/100 since there are a few nuances and isn't the greatest  but still a really enjoyable game and would highly recommend especially if your a persona fan",

You would really be doing yourself a disservice playing this before going through the prior one. \n\nOtherwise, this game is pretty fun. The music, art design, and dialogue are still great. The combat system is average, and the camera can really screw you over in tight areas. Also, the entire social life system is gone for this one. You don't really ever get a choice in what you do, as the game just pushes you from one event to the next. The characters that return are amusing, but they are snapshots of themselves from the end of Persona 5 so don't expect any real character development. I still recommend this though for fans of the previous game, because the charm mostly remains.",

As a Dynasty Warriors crossover, I feel it's a bit lacking? It doesn't quite have that 'one versus a thousand' feeling of being a badass, combat is a bit more small-scale and implements a lot of Persona gameplay for better or worse. \n\nThe story's been great so far, the new characters are really interesting, and goddamn does the P5 aesthetic continue to kick ass.\n\nLike I said, an overall recommendation from me, but I'm not exactly sure who this gameplay's intended for, while it's not *bad* it doesn't really appeal to me as a Persona fan, nor as a Warriors fan. It's a strange blend of the two that will probably work for you more if you *don't* share a fondness for both source materials, oddly enough. But it's still fine for what it needs to do and you should be here for the story. The gameplay's not bad enough to detract from that.",

        "content": "I'll try to go into some detail about why I don't recommend the game, but first I'll give a shorter version to be concise.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n\nThe game is reasonably fun, but the Warriors-style combat does not mix very well with the Persona aspects.\nThe subtle parts of writing, which the Persona series is well-known for, is missing almost entirely here.\n\nIs this a [i]BAD[/i] game?\nNo, but I am forcing myself to complete it, vs. doing so because I enjoy it.\n\n[h1]The Long Version[/h1]\n\nI could ramble for a while, but while playing, I found myself consistently complaining to myself about several several issues, which other games (including games from both the Persona series, and the Warriors games) do better, which lower my overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n* Persona-series influence on combat\n* High-level structure of the game, and clashing elements\n\nBefore I go into some of these, I want to point out, there are other topics I [i]could[/i] talk about at length, but won't be. These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n",

        "content": "Important note that this is SEQUEL to Persona 5 and should not be your jumping on point for the series. You should play and beat either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this in order to not spoil yourself on characters and events, the game assumes you have beaten that game. \n\nTo sum it up briefly, Strikers takes all the trappings from P5 and mixes in a battle system that feels like an Action-RPG in a musou's trench coat, in which you need to pay attention to weaknesses and strengths of both your team and your enemy. The game runs incredibly smooth as well, though it seems to have a 60 fps cap if that matters at all to anyone. The plot even follows a similar progression to the main game, so it can also be host to bout of nostalgia if it's been a while since you originally danced with the Phantom Thieves.  Most of the time management mechanics have been removed and you don't need to worry about hustling or figuring out who is the best to spend your time with. There are still moments where you can miss limited time items or side requests if you push on ahead without completing them. You can exit and enter dungeons without penalty and are otherwise encouraged to do so to replenish your HP and SP. Combos feel really good and even incorporate Persona skills, so you always have an avenue to attack enemy weaknesses. All the new characters are also great additions as well, and mesh well with the returning cast. \n\n30 hours in, I can still say that it should provide any P5 fans both a new and familiar experience, and it stands as probably one of my favorite Musou games, based on both the quality of the writing and the fantastic combat.  \n",

        "content": "A surprisingly sophisticated Dynasty Warriors style game that involves a lot more thought and strategy than simply deciding when to press Y after a string of Xs. You wouldn't think a turn based RPG system would blend well with a Musou style game, but the gameplay is tight and smooth as hell. You got your bloodpumping music backing your hack and slash onslaught, but you also have to be strategic and switch Personas to hit the weaknesses of your enemies, or to buff/debuff/heal as needed with items or abilities. The story is a good continuation of Persona 5, if not a little bit predictable and a bit groan worthy with the flanderization of characters. Sophia is definitely a cute, funny, and kickass addition. You don't necessarily need to playthrough and finish Persona 5 first, but a lot of small details and plot points in this game will go over your head if you don't.\n\nAll in all, a good buy. Though, I would recommend waiting for a sale like I did.",

While the turn based combat has left the scene, real time hack and slash combat fuses with the beloved Megaten mechanics to create a truly electrifying party. \n\nCoupled with amazing remixes of past P5 songs and the same characters you know and love, Strikers is a game that is hard *not* to recommend. The writing is some of the best ever put in a Megaten game, and there are so many improvements compared to Persona 5, such as UI refreshes, lighting overhauls, superior texture work, and many other additions.\n\nPersona fans and Musou fans will feel very much at home here. I am loving this game, and glad it has come to me in such a low time for the entire world. It is a ray of sunshine in a ever so gloomy and cloudy year.",

I'm sure others have had great experiences with this and are completely bug free. I'm happy for them. I'm jealous of them. I think that the gameplay is good, in a restrained Warriors way. I love P5(R) and I enjoy seeing the Thieves back together and hanging out. In short: the game is good, but my experience of trying to play it is bad. \n\nI wouldn't recommend you buy this at this moment because rolling the dice every time you hit a cutscene feels pretty horrible.

So yeah, it's a great game and I recommend it.\n\n\nUpdate: Now that I have finished the game I can properly say that this game is an amazing sequel to the original persona 5 and a true love letter to the fans. Even though p5 is getting milked to all hell, you can tell that they put the effort and made a great game which recaptures the vibe of the original while still being completely different. I do recommend however to save frequently as the game crashed twice throughout my playthrough and caused me to lose approximately 2 hours of progress.",

The way you get to roam freely during battles! The platforming and companions you meet along the way. I got into Persona 2 years ago and never thought I'd like it but the story of each game that was made of the Persona series I instantly became attached to the series. \nGraphics for the game are awesome if thats what you are looking for in a game it preforms PHENOMENALLY on my computer well with the recommendations for specs I'm sure it can run fine on a lower graphics card than mine hah. If you decide to buy the game then you did a good deed because you won't stop playing the first day I was able to play it I spent over a whole 12 hrs playing the game! YES I got into the game! But that's it for this review! Enjoy the game if you decide to get it!",

        "content": "[h1][b]A surprisingly great mash-up between [i]Musou game[/i] and [i]Persona[/i] game[/b][/h1]\n\nCombat works much more like your typical [i]Musou[/i] game, a real time hack'n slash, while also incorporates the tactical playstyle of Persona/SMT games (ie. exploiting foe's ailment weakness, 1-more/press-turn battle system, collecting personas/demons). You're in for a fresh change of pace if you came from the original turn-based combat of the Persona/SMT games.\nHowever, the negotiation system that was used in P5/P5R is absent from this game, I personally find it disappointing. Although, I think some people might find it more likeable since you don't need to went through the pain of figuring out the demon's personality, you can now just collect personas by collecting the mask that drops from battle.\n\nGraphics while not that amazing, are still stylish as it were in the original P5/P5 royal. If you like both the art direction and the graphics of the original game, you'll feel right at home when playing this game.\n\nMusics are great, some are remixes from the original P5 soundtracks, others are new addition for P5S.\n\nStory drags down a lot for the first 2 hours, and also recycle lot of story elements from the original P5 for the character's development, but there's a new story elements found in the new addition of Jails, another type of Metaverse that becomes the dungeon in P5S. I'll update my review for the story part after completing the game, for now I'll say that it feels like a bit watered down version compared to P5(I find P5R to be better than this one).\n\nPerformance is smooth, this game is highly optimized for a first port of current-gen persona game, the game managed to stay at 60fps in my GTX 1650 Ti, with all the settings maxed out in 1080p.",

New character \"Humanity's Companion\" is cute as F***. Not recommended for those just looking for a new hack n' slash, a lot of dialogue disrupts the pacing. Fans are used to it, you have been warned.\n\nPros------------------------\n\n-Unique Mushou combat experience with Persona 5 theme. All out attacks, Persona System\n\n-Story picks up after events of Persona 5 after one year\n\n-Music is great\n\n-English Va's put on a great performance (a bit subjective I understand)\n\n-Japanese voices are optional if you are not into English dubs \n\n-New Baddies (I have only fought the first boss so far) \n\n-Checkpoints are placed pretty well and makes re-entry less of a hassle taking out a lot of backtracking.\n\n-Humanity's Companion > Siri\n\n-Ambushing shadows feels great\n\nCons-------------------------\n\n- Camera can be wacky\n\n- Game is not good for players who have not played the original. No backstory, no summary of events, no recap of the original game whatsoever. \n\n- If you have not played the original, you will not be used to dialogue. There is a TON of dialogue. Great if you are a fan, annoying if you are new to the series or are just looking for a hack n' slash.\n\n- Most of the characters you bonded with in last game are MIA if they were not the main cast. Doctor, where you be? :<\n\n- \"Stealth\"",

For this to be a different genre then the other Persona or Shin Megami Tensei games, it plays almost like any other game in the series. It's the same general loop of fusing demons and abusing elemental weaknesses, but with hack and slash combat instead of the usual turn based combat. The open world, Dynasty Warriors-esque style works great for this series. The soundtrack is great. I did have some issues like crashes on cut scenes from time to time. I had to rollback my Nvidia drivers to get past a crash and progress at one point as well. Despite being soft-locked until I rolled back drivers and occasional crashing, the game is very enjoyable. Solid 9/10 overall.",

I pre-ordered the digital deluxe version of the game thinking I'd be happy, but this game BLEW my expectations out of the park! Really glad I pre-ordered it when I did. By far the combat is the biggest and best change to this game, very different and stylish compared to it's predecessors, it really works well and is better than I thought it would be! All and all, a very good game!!",

        "content": "This game is everything I could ever want from a video game. The rich persona story and formula is met with a very good adaptation of the action style combat system akin to something of warriors games/new Final Fantasy games. While this is a sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) from what I've played so far there is some prior knowledge needed about that game to enjoy this one, fortunately if you've never played P5 it shouldn't be a huge issue. Shockingly there haven't been any insanely big P5 spoilers yet, and I don't expect there to be. The music in this game is phenomenal, and the overall design of the Jails really does feel like Palaces from P5. You knocked it out of the park with this one Atlus!\n",

The battle system is more dynamic than the average warriors game, and it still stays true to the narrative and social style of the original Persona 5 as much as it can (it doesnt have social links, but has a bond system and is still very aesthetically pleasing). The only issue I've had with it so far is the loading times every now and then after launching the game, but other than that, I don't see any reason not to play the game if you're a fan of Koei Tecmo warriors games and liked or watched gameplay of Persona 5.",

        "content": "I'm prefacing this by saying you do NOT get the soundtrack and the AA is awful so there is no real advantage to getting this on steam unless it's just your preferred console. Constant 60fps is nice. Also, for the time being disable the AA because it does barely anything and blurs the text. \n\nRegarding the album/artbook promised by the front page, it's a separate executable, not files, you will not be able to put it on your phone and no reasonable person launches an exe to listen to music. They need to either scrub that off the front page, provide the soundtrack or clarify what they mean by \"soundtrack\" this is severely misleading on a storefront that also sells music.\n\nOutside of that, I really enjoy this game. It's characterization is surprisingly on point and nobody feels like a shell of their character, which is a big issue I have with persona spinoffs. On the topic of spinoffs, this is kind of a direct sequel to persona 5. I don't think you absolutely need to play the original game to understand it but I think it's most satisfying if you had. They do touch on the plot of the previous game but not really enough to spoil it in a way you would remember by the time you got around to it.\n\nAll the characters get touching moments, the new characters are very fun and the events are written to the same quality as the original Persona 5. I actually think to a degree the core dungeons are more interesting in their thematics than the original ones were. \n\nThe music is fantastic, which brings back the issue of them lying about the soundtrack. I legitimately bought this on steam because I wanted it on steam, but that's still a massive bummer. The new music is really good and the remixes I assume done by omega force are the same kinda goofy turn-off-brain guitar tracks that I love those soundtracks for. It's the best of both worlds. \n\nGameplaywise, this is probably the best translation of a turn based rpg to an action game I've seen. It's still as frenetic as a warriors game, but you will absolutely get destroyed if you ignore elemental weaknesses, which motivates the constant switching of characters, and even though it's a pretty small roster, they're all very fun to play. Also it is surprisingly difficult for a warriors game even on normal. \n\nWhen I played during the pre-release I had a few hard crashes but I stopped getting them after the first jail so either they were fixed at some point or the first jail is the location of basically all of them. Either way I would save regularly, whenever you can. \n\nAlso the Anti Aliasing needs to be improved. I know it probably will via mods but this would be a really pretty game if the aliasing didn't completely destroy all of the pleasant cleanness of it all. \n\nOverall not the best port and they lied about the soundtrack but recommended for the game itself. I hope they fix it up.",

        "content": "Redoing this since I've actually finished the adventure now, by god what a brilliant sequel.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great return to the world of the Phantom Thieves filled with just as much excitement as the original.\nAs this game is still really new (Review posted a couple of days after the release) I'll keep my thoughts brief so players can enjoy the experience on their own.\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nFor starters this [b] IS [/b] a sequel, however its a sequel to the original Persona 5 and not Royal. If you have not played the original you will be missing out a lot in the experience, some stuff straight up won't make sense (Hopefully someday Atlus releases the original to PC as well).\n\nAlthough not as long as the first instalment, P5S's story involves the Phantom Thieves taking a road trip all over Japan. This new setting really allowed the developers to expand more on the world of the Persona franchise with many hints to previous games (Haha Hotspring incident). The story is told incredibly well and is a nice change of pace avoiding rehashing the first games plot too much. \n\nFun Fact:\nFunnily enough, this exact concept is what the original Persona 5 developers wanted for the first game although it was scraped due to inappropriate timing alongside real world events (Great East Japan Earthquake).\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nAs the game was made in combination with ATLUS and Omega Force (The company behind the Warrior fighting games such as Dynasty Warriors, Hyrule Warriors etc) The gameplay is [b] very [/b] different to any other Persona game in the franchise. Instead of the same turn based combat found across the series, you are instead greeted to Warriors-Styled Hack&Slash gameplay which pairs extremely well with Personas core concepts. I would be confident saying the combat style rivals the turn based nature of the other games in the franchise, although it sometimes can feel pretty messy with everything happening at once cluttering up your screen. It is certainly a tonne of fun though.\n\nIn future I would honestly be down to see a full Persona game adopting this fighting style again. Of course keep the turn based combats for the main releases, however if Omega Force wants to partner with ATLUS for another Persona/Warriors game, I'm most certainly down.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nHoly fuck, the music in this game is amazing. P5S basically takes the original P5's soundtrack and mixes it with more upbeat styles to fit the more quickened gameplay, with heaps of rock elements added alongside. \n\nIt would be a sin against this game to not give the soundtrack a perfect score as a minimum, Its that good. \n\n[u]Wrapping it Up:[/u]\nAs stated above, I really don't want to go too deep into the story elements as this game is still very new. Just know it gets an almost perfect score from me with its only flaw being it had to follow the original, and that in all honesty is unfair. \n\nif you have played Persona 5/Royal and your looking for more Phantom Thief action, pick this one up.\n\n\n\n\n\n [h1] Makoto best girl btw [/h1]",

Overall this is a fun side adventure that lets you spend more time with your favourite characters and travel all over Japan.",

        "content": "This review is coming from a player who has not played Persona 5.\nI played Persona 4 when it released on steam and loved it and I was very much interested in the art style of Persona 5 and also followed its release and reviews on PS4. But I don't own any console and wanted to experience. So when P5S was announced I was very much excited, then I come to know that it will be pretty different experience than mainline series with hack and slash gameplay but with characters of P5. I was in a doubt whether I will enjoy this or not because of lack of connections with the lore + characters from the P5. But still I went for it.\nNow the question is did I enjoy this? \nYes, absolutely (to my surprise!)\nCharacters are introduced in a way you get a chance to know about them and chemistry between them (yes, it won't match the connection you might have if played P5 but still its serviceable)\nGameplay is fun and will keep you playing.\nOne big con for the port is that it's unstable as hell (I played early access version so it might not reflect the product on release day) as I experienced multiple crashes when changing between the locations. [This problem has bigger consequence because the game doesn't have autosave system and you can only save at particular locations. So, there is a chance that you might lose large chunk of progress, thus I advise you to save frequently.)\nSo to conclude, I am enjoying the game. Yes, I would have enjoyed it more if (1) I didn't face so many crashes and (2) had played Persona 5.\nSo I do recommend this game to anyone who has played the previous game, but if you haven't I suggest you go with an open mind and you might enjoy the company of the Phantom Thieves.\n\u00a0\nPS- Please ATLUS, don't leave players like me hanging, and give us a PC port of Persona 5 Royal.",

        "content": "I already downloaded this game on the ps japan store a while ago, so it's cool to understand what they are saying now. A sort of sequel to persona 5 vanilla, before the 5R new semester. Tons of great persona 5 slice of life action, paired with a dynasty warriors beat em up game. The dynasty warriors part is done better than any other game of its kind. Super fun to summon persona super moves and dart around the map KH3 style. It's a spin off for sure, but it is a really really well done spin off. Like watching anime filler that you forget is even filler because some of the new characters feel like canon.\n\nIf you have never played persona, should you get this? Personally, I think if you are curious about persona, this wouldn't be a bad way to dip your toe into it's universe before deciding if you want to commit to 120 hrs and possibly having to buy a ps 3/4/5. Will be most satisfying to persona 5 vanilla players who have yet to beat royal.",

        "content": "As someone who never really played Musou games, P5S was originally an odd concept but i was willing to give it a shot on account of it being more Persona 5 and a good excuse to spend time with the Phantom Thieves. \n\nI expected it to be a Musou game with a P5 skin but what we have here is a Persona game with Musou mechanics. The charm and style of Persona is dominant and is present in everything. If you enjoyed the cast and story of P5, but not the combat, i would 100% recommend this as it truly feels like a P5 sequel with action combat and no social management (but don't worry, you'll spend plenty of time in running around, in cut scenes and story beats with your crew. \n\nOverall, as a huge fan of P5, this is a must. The combat is fast pace and refreshing and absolutely captures the essence of the original game. I wish it did have some social stuff but as a spin off, it's fine as is. \n\nMy one slight negative is that if you never played P5 or watched the story, they don't really explain much and it does jump right in after the events of P5 so new players, be aware that some of the game kinda expect you to know what previously happened. \n\nOn the technical side, i'm playing on an ultra-wide monitor at 3440x1440 with a 2080ti and the performance is flawless. constant 75+ fps. No frame loss but i will say that at this time, the game does not support ultra-wide so i get black bars on the side do restrict it to 2560x1440. Not aware of any workaround for that yet.",

I think it is a bit strange for ATLUS to release a sequel to Persona 5 on PC because, again, it can be rather awkward.\n\nI will say that this game is EXTREMELY pretty. Another plus is that, unlike Persona 4 where you feel like you're playing a Hero, this game makes me feel like I'm playing a BADASS. Persona 4 has one of favorite games of all time, but never did that game have me smile in satisfaction over the gameplay.\n\nNow, remember before buying that if you haven't played the original Persona 5 that you will be missing out on a TON of backstory. I knew this myself when I got the game and I'm sorta just rolling with it. It's a bit like if you started Game of Thrones starting in season 3, which from my experience is also really awkward. On the flip side it makes going through to previous stories rather fun because then you get a \"prequel\" feel from them.\n\nPersonally this is a 7/10, which will probably be bumped up to a 10/10 when the original game comes out. I'm actually rather confident it'll be a 10/10 but without knowing the backstory to such a dramatic extent I don't know whether or not the current story is good or not. I wouldn't recommend this to someone on PC who hasn't played the original Persona 5, unless like me they were willing to overlook a bunch of missing backstory.",

        "content": " I have played through the game enough to now have a better written opinion of it. In general, I think this is a good game and enjoyed most of my time with it. However, there is definitely parts I did not like.\n\nStory:\n For the most part, I thought the story was fun. There were times where it got dull or just felt extremely rushed that I didn't like, but I overall liked the story. There is a decent amount of parts that do feel like reuses of things that happened in the series before, mainly Persona 5. Those didn't really bother me too much except for at a certain point in the story that I just found to be extremely lazy writing. I also found two of the villains to either be too \"evil\" or not a bad person for the most part.\n\nGameplay:\n Personally I love the gameplay. I find it really fun and a unique twist on the gameplay style for the type of game this is. If you are not a fan of the beat em up style of Warriors games, then you'll probably not like the gameplay as much. However, there is enough differences in my opinion that would make it worth a shot atleast. It also has the dungeon crawling of a normal Persona game, just not exactly the same. There is more expansive spaces than a typical Persona game.\n\nCharacters:\n For the most part I really liked the returning cast and the new cast added to this game. There were some points I found the returning cast used the same jokes too much, but other than that I liked them about as much as in P5/P5R. I honestly loved the new main cast characters. I found their character arcs, story and personality amazing. They were just overall really good characters. There were some not as major characters that I really liked as well. Overall, I just really liked the characters of this game.\n\nSound:\n I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this game. All the returning songs were great and all the new songs were amazing. There are even remixes of some returning songs and those remixes are so so good. The rest of the sounds were overall pretty good. There were only a few times where I didn't think sounds fit what was going on. As an example, there were some moves that just didn't fit the noise they made and threw me off.\n\n \n In the end, I still feel this is a really good game and a pretty good sequel to Persona 5. I also think it could fit for P5R a bit more than I originally thought when I got it. However, I'd only really recommend getting it if you're a fan of Persona, specifically Persona 5, and if you like the gameplay style. There is also a decent amount of bugs that have been reported and a few I have had, but they are working on them. Atlus recently put out a hotfix beta that, since using, I have not had any problems with the game.",

The combat system is very enjoyable and can get difficult sometimes but the challenge added is what makes it enjoyable in the end. The cast of characters is super neat and each plays differently for different scenarios requiring you to think strategically as to who you bring with you into the certain jails. Overall a great successor to Persona 5 and I would highly recommend this game to anyone else who is a fan of this series as a whole.",

        "content": "32 hours in and I just got past Jail number [spoiler] 5 [/spoiler] and I'm thoroughly hooked. Brings me right back to April of 2017. I've been playing this on the Digital Deluxe Pre-release, and while there are a few issues with loading screens, they'll likely be fixed with the day one patch.\n\nGameplay wise, this FEELS like Persona, but as an action game. There's some Dynasty Warriors/Musou influence, yes, but it doesn't have the same map control/base defense loop that Musou often has in its spinoffs (e.g. Hyrule Warriors) and instead opts to give much more of the stage to Persona 5. For returning fans, Fusion is back, but it's less about picking which Personas you want to fuse, and is a bit more linear. The most important part is getting different Personas, since EACH ONE will CHANGE Joker's moveset in few ways, and the Persona he has equipped can freely cast some preset skills (tied to each individual Persona) by using his Persona combo finishers. You can still fuse some pretty impressive Personas if you want to, with Reflect/Absorbs and the like, but it's not as important.\n\n\nThe other characters all feel really, really good; even in comparison to Joker, and they EACH have their own unique attribute to set them apart! Basically, Ryuji's ability is charged attacks, Makoto's is motorcycle, Haru can hold her strong attacks out, etc.. Building your party around which playstyles you like right from the get go is nice too.\n\nStory wise and in play, it feels like Persona 5-2. Some scenes have already gotten to me emotionally, and if you wanted less black-and-white themes in Persona 5 and more gray, you should be pleased with the Jail Monarchs in this game. Jumping right back in with the old cast feels natural, and while you can tell the writers had fun referencing the community, everyone feels like they're still them.\nI also like the implication that everyone isn't starting from ground zero as Phantom Thieves; they're rusty, but they're still more than capable of taking out hordes of shadows by themselves.\n\nI don't like out of 10 ratings, so I'll say this is a damn fun game and I recommend it to anyone who likes Persona 5. If you haven't played 5, I do REALLY recommend playing that first, but this game honestly doesn't do a terrible job reviewing what is what for first timers.\nEven if you don't like Musou, you might be pleasantly surprised.",

        "content": "Dare I say, this is even better than the original P5.\nI love the rpg genre as a whole, and Persona 5 does an amazing job with it, but the action style \"dynasty warriors\" gameplay of this manages to get me a lot more invested in the game.\nYou feel like such a badass mowing through crowds of enemies with huge AoE attacks.\nThe story is also really interesting. I love the whole \"roadtrip across japan\" thing they have going on.\n[spoiler] The structure of the villains isn't too bad either, I love the idea of showing a character that's pretty much every respective phantom thief if they had taken a different route in life. [/spoiler]\nAlso Haru is the best girl in all of existence so any more interactions with her is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe only 2 cons I can see are kind of nit-picky.\n1: It doesn't include any mention of the additional story of p5 royal, but I can understand that since the japanese version of this game released before royal was added. That doesn't stop me from wanting to see more of Kasumi and Maruki, though.\n2: There's a few quality of life features taken away compared to base persona 5, like not being able to \"jog\" in the overworld. I can understand that since it was developed in part by a different studio, though.\n\nEasily the best thing in this game is that it doesn't feel like it's 90% cutscenes and it doesn't super hold your hand in the beginning like p5 did. Heck, you can skip cutscenes entirely if you want, rather than having to fast forward through them.\n\n[b] Overall: Phenomenal game. I can easily see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this game trying to 100% it, like I have with every other Persona game, from 1 to 5. \nIf you enjoy games like dynasty warriors or hyrule warriors, and you like the story of persona 5, I can not recommend this game enough.[/b]",

Its quite the opposite, being a persona game at heart with only a little bit of warriors thrown in there. Sure it doesnt have the social aspect the series is known for, but everything else is here, the great cast (from vanilla, no Sumi :( ), great dialogue and great voice acting. Its also longer then you would expect, so thats good. The combat feels very fresh, even for those that dont like the warriors games. All aspects of battle from p5 are still here, 1 mores, follow ups, all out attacks and even showtimes from royal. If youre a fan of the series, youll love it, even if it is a bit repetitive at first.\n\nBut \n\nIts got some problems on PC, so I would recommend getting it on PS4. Or run it off an SSD",

He and the rest of his Friends decided to go camping after they've got reunited. \nWhile they were gathering equipment for that camping trip, they stumbled across the metaverse yet again but this time, it's used to steal the desires from innocent people to affect them in the real world. \nThe Phantom Thieves of hearts are back from their hiatus and ready to get those stolen desires back!\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nUnlike the other persona spin-offs that were either turn based (like the main games) or 2d fighting games, this one is actually a hack and slay with persona traits in it like: \nweakness and resist, all out attacks, 1 more, debuffs and buffs, baton pass, the third eye, ambush and of course the ability to switch personas via wildcard (which is Joker). \nBut they also added many new things that are quite interesting like: \nbonds, master arts, showtimes, gaining personas by random drops, being able to use surroundings as an advantage and so on.\nThe dungeon crawling is also a big part of this game, so be prepared to slice through countless enemies while exploring the cognitive world!    \n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\nWhat is there more to say? If you have played the main game, then you know every single persona Ost is a bop and this time it's no exception.\n\nYearning to hear some good old Persona classics come back, like \"rivers in the desert\" ? Fear not, this game won't let you down. \nYou want \"last surprise\" but more funky? Here you go buddy!\nYou want new Osts that slap ass? Well with axe to grind and daredevil, there's nothing you can do wrong. \nThrough the Legacy BGM Dlc which is available through the deluxe edition, it is also possible to change the Battle theme to another one of the previous games.\n\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nEven though I haven't played that much hack and slay in general, I still enjoyed this kind of experience. \nI think this game is a great addition to the persona franchise and a fresh take on the hack and slay genre. \nThe only thing I can recommend in addition is playing the main game before touching this game, to improve your understanding of the following story as well some parts of the gameplay.",

Character writing/voice acting is a real delight, the game's combat is a fantastic blend of action-RPGs (not unlike KH2 with its Reaction Commands) and the Persona series. It's not really in the same vein as FFVII Remake, but I like the combat system here for very similar reasons to that game. Compared to other Persona spin-offs in the past, this one for sure is a definite sequel through-and-through beyond the actual plot. If you've played the original before, this isn't worth missing out on.\n\nalso sophia is adorable and i care for her",

I've looked online, and there doesn't seem to be one particular reason for the issues.\n\nSaving often is best best advice one can give for it, and even then, it's difficult to figure out if your game is gonna run for hours without issue, or if it'll crash within the next twenty minutes.

Basically, you'll want to string together your attacks to deal good damage. While you won't have access for particularly amazing personas for a while, I've never really had too many issues regarding battles with the personas you start with. As for the story, from where I'm at, it's amazing. It integrates old characters and obviously includes some new ones. The new characters are quite interesting, and will leave you in suspense until the end! This is a quick and messy review, but this really is an amazing game!! :)",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has amazing gameplay that still manages to keep that persona feel. the skill system is perfectly implemented so that you can still take your time adapting your personas and skills to the enemy's weaknesses. the way they put in SP and skills is great allowing you to pull off elemental moves easily but with a large cost of SP while also letting you use elemental moves through specials for no cost to your SP but in exchange they are harder to do and require setup. it also incorporates a new fast paced combat system that just lets you plough through enemies which is a really fun new twist on the normal persona 5 combat system. the way they have also kept ambushing and all out attacks is perfect with it still keeping the rewarding feeling of pulling them off and also balancing them so that you can't just rely on them all the time. although the confidant system is gone the new bond feature is a great replacement that encourages you to progress your relationship with the phantom thieves while also earning upgrades to your combat abilities. The game still keeps the charm of a persona game and adds to it with new areas and amazing scenes in the jails. I also like how the developers made the jails feel a lot more free roam and open to the player than palaces with their tight corridors and packed rooms, the new open air setting allows many opportunities in puzzles and movement options, a small detail like is how in some areas you can go through areas with the camera positioned to make the game play like a platformer game, this is also complimented by the new double jump and dash feature allowing for fast and diverse movement. in conclusion this game is a great sequel to persona 5 and is still extremely fun for anyone picking it up for the first time (but of course if you are picking it up for the first time the story may be less enjoyable)",

        "content": "I have played Persona 5 and I find myself enjoying Strikers quite a bit. The effort the developers went through to keep the spirit of Persona 5 alive and translate it into a different genre are quite admirable. The original music for Strikers is good and so are the remixes of music from Persona 5 itself. The only let down is the lack of a remix of Take Over from Persona 5 Royal, but that's another matter.\n\nCombat feels good for the most part, continuing the gameplay mechanics of the mainline Persona games of hitting an enemies weaknesses in combat. My main gripe is that some enemies can get extremely damage spongey, which isn't fun. The action is also fun to watch, especially as you come to learn the combat system.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend Persona 5 Strikers to anyone who loved Persona 5, as well. It's also accessible to people who never played Persona 5, containing little in the name of spoilers of the plot of P5, but obviously you'll get more out of the story and characters here if you have played Persona 5.",

I purchased this game's Deluxe to be able to play it early... and as you can tell I have been putting massive amounts of time into it and I do not regret a second of it.\nThis game is fantastic, this game does the Genre justice making it appealing for veterans who have played Dynasty Warriors/Hyrule Warriors and makes it easy for people like me who haven't played a game like this to get into the genre. And on top of it, this is a faithful sequel to Persona 5 with no plot holes that I can find.\nPlease do look into trying this game for yourself.\nI absolutely love this game.\nThe Phantom Thieves of Hearts will be waiting for you, back in Shibuya.",

        "content": "An absolutely more than worthy successor and sequel to in my opinion the best video game in years. Everything about Persona 5 Strikers down to the UI design and touching story telling feels like this is not even a spin-off but a mainline Persona game.  Everything you learned from Persona 5/Royal easily transfers over here and it is mixed with a fun, easy to understand but hard to master combat system that feels addicting and arguably almost better than the usual turn-based system the mainline games use. My only critique is that the fusion system is not as in depth as it is in the mainline Persona games, but it still holds up really well and it is fun to fuse demons; adding its own unique feature to make it more convenient.\nMixed with a brand new soundtrack alongside remixes of fan favorite songs from Persona 5, it really just does not feel like I'm playing a spin-off, it feels like I'm just actually playing Persona 5 on PC. I'm in love with everything about this game, and highly suggest it if you know the story or played the Persona 5 or its way better enhanced re-release. Here's hoping we can get Persona 5 Royal on Steam someday!",

The bugs for now however need to be fixed. Still 1000 percent recommend, but the crashing and lag in cutscenes among numerous other glitches just take away from the experience for a bit. I have already for example lost 2 hours of play time due to crashing. \n\nYou should still buy it, its really fun and a unique twist. \nSave frequently and if your cutscenes are screwed like mine you can find them on YouTube to watch them to full potential\n\n\nEdit: After finishing game, its up there on my favourite games list. As much as the fandom groans and complains about milking the series the quality for the product is really here with Strikers. The new characters are great, I'm still not sure how I feel about Royal not being connected what so ever plus the weird ending of Royal. If we take that out of the picture I think this ending after connecting to base P5 is really good. Once again the OST is phenomenal as with pretty much every Persona game. Definitely some things I'm going to add to my playlist from this game. The combat also feels really good and is a unique change of pace that still keeps Persona mechanics. \n\nMy only gripes with this game are the bugs. I know Atlus is working on it however I did not get a single cutscene that wasn't a laggy mess. As I mentioned above I had to go on YouTube to see them to their full potential. That being said when they aren't a laggy mess the cutscenes and the characters/environments look great here.\n\nFrom here on forward I couldn't really say whether I'd rather P5's characters get more arc or not. One could obviously make the argument that its being milked harder then P4 even but I wouldn't complain with one last sendoff from the P5 cast. Whether it be a P5 arena or a completely new spinoff. Or we could immediately go to P6 which I wouldn't complain about either. \n\nI started with P5 as my first game and then played P4 here on Steam. Who knows what in store for the anniversary but I would love to see P3 get the Persona 4 Remaster treatment. Beyond that, if Atlus started bringing more releases to Steam I think that would be great. \n\nTime for me to wait to try out Nocturne as my first entry into SMT",

        "content": "It's a Persona 5 game, that follows the same patterns as previous game in terms of narrative, length and approach.\n\nEven tho it's musou game, it feels like Persona game. I won't say I enjoy the battles as much as in original entry, but I do feel more immersed in the battles (also, sometimes AI does some crazy shit and you must fight 1 vs boss, which I find quite confusing).  Also, I should not that you won't have as much social interactions as in previous entry, which might disappoint some people.\n\nThe plot feels strong (tho I find it a little bit repetitive), new characters are unique as it usually happens in Persona games.\n\nAnyway, if you are a Persona 5 and/or hack-slash games fan, you should get this game. It would be VERY preferable to play Persona 5 Royal or Persona 5 before playing this to better understand the plot and how the game world works, but it's not on PC (yet?). \n\nP.S. This review is based in the first 10 hours of the game. I'll update it when I finish it",

        "content": "[b] This game is not Persona 5. It is a sequel/spinoff, at the time of this review, there is no official means to play the original Persona 5 outside of on a Playstation. This game does also have some mild spoilers for the original. Keep this in mind if you saw this game on the store and assumed it was Persona 5. [/b]\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is an incredibly enjoyable game. It attempts to create what I would describe to be a lighter RPG experience as compared to Persona, but an experience that still remains unique and enjoyable in itself.\n The combat is an incredible blend between the Musou style hack-and-slash combat, and the turn based strategy of the Persona series. This combat is wildly entertaining, being probably one of my favorite of these types of action games. It plays in typical real-time, but has several options that will take a minute and freeze the action to allow you to make a decision, such as summoning your Persona to use a skill, or pulling out your gun. These options help make it feel a little more close to home for Persona combat. \nPlayers of Persona 5 will feel familiar with the new \"jails\" that are the dungeons, although they have a bit of a different feel from the palaces of the original. The dungeons are no longer a single contained building such as a Castle or a Bank. They are instead the scale entire cities and towns with themes around them, such as a carnival feeling design, or a city that has been frozen over and covered in snow. One detriment to this increase in size is the gutting of many stealth mechanics from the original, there aren't nearly as many corners to hide around and places to sneak past enemies in this game, and the spots you can jump to and hide in seem a little tacked on, this doesn't hurt the actual gameplay in any way, but it does remove some of the thief feeling that was present in Persona 5. \nHowever, the action sections are not all this game has to offer.\nThere are also segments in this game outside the dungeons that offer both social elements to the player, and opportunities to stock up on supplies and gear before entering a dungeon once more. These experiences, like the combat, are quite different from the original game. Instead of a vast amount of social links and a huge city with a lot of areas, Strikers is much more condensed, while it does take place in multiple cities, the explorable areas are much smaller. This is not a bad thing however, as these areas are still fun to explore and interact with. The social elements are also condensed, mostly just consisting of hanging out with members of your parties in small bite sized interactions, such as visiting a a local ramen shop with a couple friends. There is a replacement for the bonuses you would have gotten from the Confidant system present in Persona 5 however, and that is the \"bond\" level. Everytime you hang out with your friends or complete a quest for them, your bond level will increase, which essentially gives you points to let you pick out some skills from a chart. This can incentivize players to pursue these social events to help level up their combat abilities. Though, if you dread the idea of these kinds of features and want to only play the game for the action segments, you can skip these events entirely. Both progressing the story and winning battles will also naturally increase your bond level, so you are not required to do these events to gain the benefits. Although, if you enjoy the characters even a little bit, the events are very much worth doing as they are quite charming.\n\nOverall I think this is a fantastic game. If you're a fan of Persona 5 and want more, I can say it should definitely be in your consideration. It offers a familiar, yet different experience and is overall a good time.\n If you haven't played Persona 5 and are interested in it, the game does seem to be designed to accommodate these kinds of players, by sort of introducing all of the main cast and not really requiring you to know the previous story, but the game does at some points call back to events and characters from the original game. I would say that for a lot of people, they should probably wait until they can play the original game in some capacity, whether that be Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n If you're someone who just wants a fun action game and doesn't care about the characters or story, you would be getting a very fun and interesting combat system, but the other features with the social and story elements might make the rest of the experience feel a little hollow.",

        "content": "NOTE: to those who may be stuck on the initial loading screens when opening the game: Hit Alt+Enter to change the game from Windowed Mode to Fullscreen, or vice versa. I found it worked for me.\n\nSome background. I've played P3FES, P4G, and P5 vanilla, and I was so excited for this game. However, If you're looking for an RPG experience like the typical persona games, you won't find it here. It is a more \"on the rails\" linear storyline. That being said, if you enjoy hack and slash gameplay or are invested in the characters, I can't reccomend the game enough. All the praises I could say about the game, you will likely hear from the others. What I do want to do is give some notes for those who are on the fence about the game/wonder about technicalities about the PC port.\n\nSome notes:\n       - As many have noted, this game has a LOT going on at once on your screen. The combat starting out will be clunky, stiff, and a bit challenging at first. You could say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this game. But give it some time and you'll eventually learn to filter out the noise and navigate battles like an expert. Making use of your dash and your special (Y button on the controller) will allow for some of the most fluid combat I've gotten a chance to play in a hack and lash.\n\n       - This game is an anti aliasing nightmare. If you can, before starting a new game, turn on anti aliasing and crank up the resoulution scale to 2.0. In classic persona fashion, you won't be able to access the pause menu until you get through the tutorials.\n\n        - This game is locked to 60fps. It's a real shame considering I wanted to make full use of my 144hz monitor, but we'll have to see if we'll get a community mod for that, or if it's set to 60 because the game logic will break because of a high framerate.\n\n        - The voice mixing in this game is kind of horrendous. Characters sound different (especially joker) and in some parts, voices are too quiet, like the VAs were standing too far away from the microphones. Still, this is an amazing feat considering that all of the voicework was recorded from home due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n        - The battles are fairly easy for me, and I've played only a few hack and slash's growing up. If you are a hack and slash expert, I'd put the difficulty on \"hard\". You are free to change the difficulty whenever you wish during the game.\n\n        -  There is a lot of reading, like traditional persona games. If you're not into that, you may want to give picking this up a second thought.  If you have never played Persona 5, I reccomend watching a playthrough or playing it yourself before jumping into this game as it does not give much background into the plot of P5.\n\nThis game is a whole lot of fun, and I want to thank the developers at Atlus for putting in the time to port this game to PC. Here's hoping for the other persona games to come to PC!",

        "content": "With just one day in-game and without having finished it, I can say that I am very satisfied. The new combat system feels quite nice, sure, it has its problems, the original key mapping (Keyboard) is not quite pleasant at least from my perspective, but is very configurable, which will give you a chance to accommodate a lot better. In the same way, other minor detail such as the mouse camera that can be a little weird.\n\nWithout anything else to say, the only thing to conclude is that P5S is a great successor, the story as per usual is very entertaining and the whole game itself is very good.\n\nHighly recommended",

        "content": "[quote][h1]Full review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuYTl-_t6ZI\nSummarized review below![/h1][/quote]\nJapan and releasing sequels on platforms that don\u2019t have the original, name a more iconic duo. Regardless, at least ATLUS seems keen on bringing their games to more platforms, so I was excited to finally give Strikers a play.\n\n[b]Note: Had to trim review to fit character limit, check video for full version![/b]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nUnlike Persona 5, Strikers is co-developed with Omega Force, the studio most well-known for the Musou series. Strikers adopts that same kind of hack-and-slash gameplay, but with a bit of a Persona twist. For example, while you are still mowing down hordes of enemies at a time like in a Musou game, you\u2019re also able to pause mid-combat to make use of your Persona skills. These skills have elemental traits and there are matchups with enemies that can cause you to do more or less damage dependent on their traits. In fact, you pretty much have to account for these matchups with bigger enemies as otherwise you\u2019ll be merely tickling them.\n\n[h2]Difficulty/Combat Feel:[/h2]\nThe combat difficulty can be a bit hit or miss. It\u2019s always fun to blow through these massive groups of enemies with your big persona skills, but the boss fights can drag a bit \u2013 as all of them are effectively giant damage sponges. This is rooted in the combat\u2019s lack of impact. You don\u2019t really FEEL like you\u2019re hitting most enemies or taking damage, you just kinda see it reflected on-screen. There\u2019s little in the way of audio and visual feedback to really give the combat that sense of meatiness.\n\nThis is par for the course for a Musou game though, which I am a fan of by the way so I can\u2019t say this was too unexpected, but I had at least hoped that a Persona crossover would have upped their game a bit.\n\n[h2]Combat Depth:[/h2]\nThis is not your traditional Musou game where you can go in and just start swinging \u2013 there\u2019s a lot more of a tactical emphasis this time around. The persona mechanic I mentioned earlier is easily the biggest change there. As Joker, you\u2019re able to equip a set number of these personas and they can be customized, fused, and upgraded to your liking in the velvet room. It can get pretty complex there too \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had for those that enjoy min-maxing.\n\nHowever, the combat also has an increased emphasis on movement. Not only are you going to have to make effective use of your dodge ability, but there\u2019s also follow-up attacks that will have you zipping across the screen and a neat \u201cphantom dash\u201d mechanic that allows you to make use of the environment to do certain special attacks. And this is on top of the fact that you can swap to and from your different party members at any time \u2013 each with their own unique combat quirk. I had a lot of fun figuring out how each played and coming up with an optimal party, swapping members out occasionally to suit certain bosses and such.\n\n[h2]Combat Cont.:[/h2]\nYou enter a new area, wipe the enemies, proceed to the next, and repeat all the way until the boss. It can feel a bit repetitive at times, but the added depth kept me interested enough to keep going \u2013 and again, this is all with a Persona twist, so you\u2019ll get a lot of story scenes and such in-between. Some minor changes I would like to see are improvements to the ally AI and the ability to skip battle cutscenes. Seeing that flashy super move for the first few times? Great, but not the hundred or so times after that.\n\n[h2]Level Design:[/h2]\nUnfortunately, Strikers falls into that JRPG pitfall of having incredibly basic and oftentimes blocky levels. Hallways connecting square rooms, invisible walls everywhere, and crude use of the already limited movement abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all there and unfortunate to see in what otherwise is a visually appealing game. The exploration of course takes a hit in the process. The blocky layout makes for much more linear levels and the chests and other hidden goodies are usually just down another hallway or in some other easily accessible location \u2013 there\u2019s no sense of \u201cwow, they actually hid a chest here?\u201d\n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nIf you liked the story in Persona 5, you will absolutely like the story here as well. It\u2019s got the fun character interactions, the plot twists, the social commentary (even if heavy-handed), and some decent pacing backing it all up. It was nice to see the gang get back together for another adventure, one that quite literally has them traveling the country.\n\nThe plot follows a similar structure to the first game. The first few jails (this game's palaces) I was like \u2013 okay, this is basically the same thing as the first story \u2013 but it started to deviate as it went on and the differences between the palaces of the first game and the jails of Strikers became more apparent. Then, towards the end, it ramps up and becomes this much bigger thing \u2013 in classic Persona fashion.\n\n[h2]Can I Play Without Playing the First?[/h2]\nThere\u2019s no \u201ccatching up\u201d here, Strikers just dumps you right into things expecting you to know all the characters and events from the first game. For those that have no knowledge of the story, there are a few options. Of course, the best would be to just play Persona 5 or Royal. However, as neither were ever released on PC, that might not be an option for many. The second would be to simply watch Persona 5 the Animation. I know fans like to dunk on it, but it\u2019s honestly not that bad and will set you up perfectly to understand the story in Strikers. If neither of those work, well, you could just read or watch a summary, but that\u2019s definitely not an approach I would recommend.\n\n[h2]Graphics/Music:[/h2]\nRight off the bat, it\u2026 doesn\u2019t look any different from the original \u2013 so if you liked that look \u2013 well, nothing changed. The music on the other hand, that absolutely slaps. It did in Persona 5 and it does again with Strikers, adding a bunch of new music while also including some excellent remixes of tracks from the original.\n\n[h2]PC Port:[/h2]\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad port, but it\u2019s far from great. The biggest disappointment comes in the fact that it is locked to 60 fps. That 60 fps is at least stable though, only dipping during loading screens where you can\u2019t tell. Strikers also has higher resolution support, including 1440p (which I played at with no issues) and 4K.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts describing constant crashing issues and infinite load screens, but the game only ever crashed on me once, and it was during a dialogue scene shortly after I saved, so nothing lost there. Regardless, this is something that I hope the devs look into, as any crashes at all is worth fixing. Otherwise the game ran flawlessly. I had no further bugs or technical issues of any kind.\n\n[h2]Controls:[/h2]\nI went with an Xbox One controller and had no issues aside from the lack of rumble, but I believe that to be a bug as it also affects PS4 controllers. On keyboard/mouse, the controls are functional (and can be remapped) but are not ideal. On mouse especially, there\u2019s a permanent negative acceleration effect, where the faster you move the mouse, the slower the camera moves. There is at least mouse input in menus, but I would recommend a controller for this one.\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nStrikers is yet another nice addition to the series, offering up several changes of its own while staying true to what makes Persona great. There\u2019s the interesting story with all its twists and turns, the fun characters with all their quirks, and the top-notch visual presentation and music on top of that. The combat has its ups and downs though, bringing more depth than what is usual for a Musou game, but bringing that genre\u2019s problems along with it (particularly the lack of impact and damage sponging). Regardless, it\u2019s still a fun time and a worthwhile experience if you want to see the story continued.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews!",

Solid 60 (which it is currently locked to unfortunately) and the game looks beautiful.  From the settings it seems like this doesn't go higher than 1080p, but I did bump the rendering scale up to 2.0 which helped make everything look smoother.\n\nDid have 3 crashes so far and one instance where I opened the menu to save and the menu just refused to load causing me to have to quit out.  This is a problem that I hope they address since there is no auto-save which does feel odd in it's omission.  I do think that some of these bugs might have happened since I was tabbing in and out a bunch to discord, and I was running in Border-less Windowed Mode.\n\nOverall I am really really enjoying this and I can't wait to sink a ton more hours in!",

Love both new characters the game added, both very funny and add positively to the main squad. Gameplay is fun, a very persona-ish spin on your classic warriors game, so expect a bit of a mix there. Game has been running great without any issues for me, great port so far.\n\nThank you for bringing this to PC ATLUS, we appreciate any persona title that you guys can toss at us :)\n\n[i]-Makoto is best girl[/i]",

        "content": "so, I just put the game down after a long time, finished it, and I actually really like it. For context, long time fan, my first game was Persona 3 for the PS2, didn't finish, came back and finished P3FES around 2011, then bought a vita for P4G a little later, and fell in love with the franchise. I routinely get people into persona so you can imagine my surprise seeing P4G, then this game on steam! That being said, I decided to wait out persona 5 royal for a PC release, but I have played the original P5, so I had to grab this.\n\nWhat a great game! I think this is the best Persona spin off yet, having played the dancing games, fighting games, and persona Q. My last game of theirs was the -- rather disappointing-- Persona Q2. This game, though, Ignore the price tag, it's deserving off the full price, even being a spin off, it feels more like a sequel, with eight dungeons, and a ton to do. The combat is less dynasty warriors than I was expecting, and leans more toward a standard ARPG moveset. Playing on normal, you actually had to pay attention to weaknesses, and definitely couldn't just button mash through the game.\n\nPersona spinoff tropes like the throwaway characters are present here, but I actually liked the characters they added, which I almost never do, except the ones from Persona Q. The areas felt new and interesting, I loved the layout, and things felt much more expansive than Persona 5's Palaces, and that's saying a TON because those were already pretty fleshed out. One is a police officer in a troubled relationship with his daughter and the other is a robot questioning how to be human, which are character designs that are molded from persona 4 and 3 respectively. I was disappointed at first, but they really turned the characters into their own, and they sort of molded into their own, I left the game enjoying their characters a lot more than I did coming in, especially the police officer.\n\nI'm not too fond of the cast of Persona 5 and I still found myself pretty invested in the story. Right when the Palace format started to get boring, they switched things up and had an unexpected ending. That being said, there are a few spoilers for Persona 5, however I believe this game doesn't exist in the continuity of Persona 5 : Royal, so if you're worried about spoilers for that game, you're good. That being said, you have to wonder why we don't have Persona 5, or Royal on steam yet. I know for sure that there are people waiting to play this, since it's basically a sequel to the original. The character and bonus content that was revealed in Royal doesn't seem to affect the cast of this game's continuity, very strange considering the events of P3FES are considered canon, same for P4G.\n\n\nGreat port, I had a few crashes but they were following about 7 hours of consecutive play (oops). Other than that, great optimization, Persona 5's graphics look so much better at 4K 60fps! Great job as always Atlus, i'd love to see Royal on here, as well as Persona Q and some of the other spin off games! If you're on the fence, grab it to support Atlus' PC presence! They were already pretty Anti-PC for years, and i'm thinking the sales of P4G are what coaxed them into releasing more on here. Amazing game, the soundtrack I actually like better than the original. Another banger Atlus title.",
